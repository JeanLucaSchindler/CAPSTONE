,Irish PM tests positive for Covid on US trip,Micheál Martin had been due to take part in the White House shamrock ceremony later on Thursday.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60776392?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC News - UK,general,en,gb,2022-03-17T10:47:53+00:00,"MicheÃ¡l Martin and Joe Biden met virtually after Mr Martin tested positive for Covid
US President Joe Biden has warned that too much ""blood, sweat and tears"" have been shed on the Good Friday Agreement to change it now.
He also praised the Irish government's response to the Ukrainian conflict in bringing in 7,000 refugees.
The president was speaking during a virtual meeting with Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin to celebrate St Patrick's Day.
The talks were held remotely after Mr Martin tested positive for Covid.
President Biden said he was disappointed the two leaders could not meet in person.
In reply the taoiseach said they met virtually last year across the Atlantic because of the pandemic and now they year were meeting virtually across the road.
President Biden then reaffirmed his government support for the Good Friday Agreement,the deal which ended the worst of almost 30 years of violenceknown as the Troubles.
""I want to emphasise this administration's unequivocal support for the Good Friday accord,"" he said
""I think too much blood, sweat and tears have been shed to get that done. And this is no time to change it.""
Mr Martin tested positive for Covid on Wednesday night
Both leaders also talked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the taoiseach praised the president's ""firm and measured"" response to the war
President Biden said he was impressed with the Republic of Ireland's response in brining in more than 7,000 Ukrainian refugees.
Mr Martin had to isolate after he was informed of a positive Covid test while attending the Ireland Fund dinner in Washington on Wednesday night.
At the time he was sitting alongside House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other guests.
The taoiseach had been due to receive an international leadership award at the event.
However, when the moment arrived Ireland's Ambassador to the United States, Dan Mulhall, took to the stage and confirmed the positive test.
He said Mr Martin had tested negative but then was re-tested after a member of his delegation received a positive result.
He said the taoiseach had re-tested out of an ""abundance of caution"" and added that he was in ""good form"" but very disappointed.
""It is a sad thing which I have to do which is to deliver the taoiseach's speech on his behalf,"" he said.

Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood, who was at the dinner, said it was a big blow for the taoiseach.
""It is very sad. This is a major event for any taoiseach, going into the White House on St Patrick's Day, and that now won't happen. I feel very sorry for him,"" he said
He said the news had left everyone ""deflated"" at the dinner and with the taoiseach's office due to be rotated later this year, he said Mr Martin would not get another chance to celebrate St Patrick's Day in the White House.
The water in the White House north lawn fountain was turned green to mark St Patrick's Day in 2021
During the gala dinner on Wednesday, President Biden and Mrs Pelosi addressed the gathering.
Mrs Pelosi issued a warning to the UK over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
She said that if the ""border is hardened there will be no UK-US trade deal"".
She also warned against any move which ""imperils"" the Good Friday Agreement.

Key among the discussions is likely to be challenges and opportunities in energy markets for island nations.
The energy market in Japan is becoming more dynamic and complex, but this is creating significant opportunities for businesses to support the grid and change how they power their operations. During his visit, Mr. Martin will meet with GridBeyond representative Shunsuke Amanai to discuss the global energy crisis and to share lessons learned on how island markets can best manage volatility in a high renewables' future.
Japan's energy system is changing due to rising levels of renewable power and ongoing electricity market reforms. The result is a growing need for flexible resources to help balance the intermittency of renewables and help match demand and supply. In addition, like many markets across the globe, Japan is experiencing extreme tightness of electricity supply and demand. As a result, the government has been requesting power conservation. While action on the demand side of the market is relatively new in the Japanese market, this is a mature and proven industry in Ireland and the UK with C&I businesses able to gain revenues and make significant cost savings, provided they have the right technology in place.
Using artificial intelligence and data science, GridBeyond's solution enables businesses to participate in grid services and wholesale markets using their energy generation, storage and industrial load.
GridBeyond started activities in the Japanese market nearly a year ago. Last year, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Chiyoda Corporation to roll out flexibility solutions for the Japanese electricity market and it is currently getting ready to open an office in the country later this year.
Michael Phelan, GridBeyond's CEO commented:
""Japan has a strong sustainable focus and aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. As renewable energies, energy storage, decentralised solar PV and EV mobility become more present in the energy landscape, services as the Demand Side Response become critical to support business and the grid operators to balance supply and demand of power, increase resilience and enable further integration of renewables into the energy mix.""

Beim Bloody-Sunday-Massaker 1972 in der nordirischen Stadt Derry wurden 13 friedliche Demonstrierende von britischen Soldaten erschossen. Auch gut 50 Jahre später gibt es noch keine Verurteilungen, obwohl London die Unrechtmäßigkeit bereits zugab. Nun soll die künftige Aufarbeitung verboten werden – Irlands Premier Micheál Martin ist empört.
Dublin.Der irische Premierminister Micheál Martin hat die Amnestie-Pläne der britischen Regierung für Soldaten und ehemalige Paramilitärs im Nordirland-Konflikt kritisiert.
Britische Soldaten, die beispielsweise in die Tötung von Zivilisten beim Bloody-Sunday-Massaker 1972 verwickelt waren, müssten zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden, sagte Martin am Mittwoch im irischen Parlament in Dublin. „Das wäre komplett inakzeptabel, es wäre ein Verrat an den Opfern aller Gewalt“, sagte Martin weiter. Die Regierung in London habe die Aufarbeitung der Gewalt in Nordirland schon viel zu lange verschleppt.
Das Bloody-Sunday-Massaker in der nordirischen Stadt Derry, die offiziell Londonderry genannt wird, jährt sich am 30. Januar zum 50. Mal. Britische Soldaten eröffneten damals während eines weitgehend friedlichen Protestmarschs das Feuer auf Demonstranten. 13 Menschen starben dabei, 15 wurden verletzt. Obwohl die britische Regierung 2010 nach Veröffentlichung eines Untersuchungsberichts anerkannte, dass die Tötungen ungerechtfertigt waren, musste sich bis heute niemand vor Gericht dafür verantworten.
Nun will London einen Strich unter die juristische Aufarbeitung ziehen. Die im vergangenen Jahr vorgestellten Pläne sehen ein Verbot für weitere Verfahren im Zusammenhang mit der Gewalt während Konflikts vor. Sie werden jedoch von allen Seiten in der ehemaligen Bürgerkriegsregion abgelehnt.

Die DUP hatte nach dem historischen Wahlsieg der katholisch-republikanischen Partei Sinn Fein angekündigt, einer Einheitsregierung erst dann beizutreten, wenn der Streit um den Brexit-Status des zum Vereinigten Königreich gehörenden Landesteils gelöst ist.
Laut dem als Karfreitagsabkommen bekannten Friedensschluss von 1998 müssen sich die jeweils stärksten Parteien der beiden konfessionellen Gruppen in der früheren Bürgerkriegsprovinz auf eine Einheitsregierung einigen, andernfalls droht die politische Lähmung.
""Das war eine Wahl, bei der es um aktuelle Themen ging. Und daher denke ich, dass Parteien an Unterstützung verlieren könnten, wenn sie nicht auf das reagieren, was ihnen die Menschen an der Türschwelle gesagt haben"", sagte Martin dem irischen Sender RTÉ am Montag. Er fügte hinzu, es sei nun die Pflicht der Parteien, sich auf eine Regierung zu einigen. Im Wahlkampf hatten vor allem die steigenden Lebenshaltungskosten, Gesundheit und Wohnungsnot eine Rolle gespielt.
Auch die Regierungen in Großbritannien und den USA hatten die Parteien dazu aufgefordert, rasch eine Einheitsregierung zu bilden. Der britische Nordirland-Minister Brandon Lewis wollte sich noch am Montag mit Vertretern der wichtigsten Parteien treffen.
Das Wahlergebnis gilt als historisch: Mit dem starken Abschneiden Sinn Feins bei der Wahl steht erstmals einer Partei das Amt der Regierungschefin zu, die sich für die Loslösung Nordirlands von Großbritannien und eine Vereinigung mit der Republik Irland einsetzt./cmy/DP/eas",Positive

Anders als von London behauptet, komme die Wirtschaft in Nordirland sehr gut klar mit den vereinbarten Regelungen.
Die Regierung des britischen Premierministers Boris Johnson hatte am vergangenen Montag einen Gesetzentwurf vorgelegt, der die Regelungen des im Brexit-Vertrag vereinbarten Nordirland-Protokolls einseitig ändern soll. London will damit erzwingen, dass Brüssel das erst 2019 vereinbarte Abkommen wieder aufmacht. Die EU-Kommission schließt das strikt aus und will stattdessen über Lösungen im Rahmen der bestehenden Vereinbarung verhandeln.
London droht unter anderem damit, die in dem Protokoll vereinbarten Warenkontrollen zum Schutz des EU-Binnenmarkts durch eine freiwillige Regelung zu ersetzen. Zudem soll die Rolle des Europäischen Gerichtshofs drastisch beschränkt werden. London will sich auch freie Hand bei Regelungen zur Mehrwertsteuer geben.

Dublin.Irland hebt fast alle Corona-Regeln auf. Von diesem Samstag an dürfen Pubs, Restaurants und Discos wieder öffnen, ohne Impfnachweise zu verlangen oder Abstandsregeln zu beachten, wie Regierungschef Micheal Martin am Freitagabend in Dublin sagte.
Teilnehmerbeschränkungen für Veranstaltungen fallen ebenso weg wie Vorschriften für private Treffen. Vom kommenden Montag an endet zudem die Pflicht zum Homeoffice. Für internationale Reisen gelten allerdings noch immer die 3G-Regeln, wie Martin sagte. Wer positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet wird, muss sich weiterhin isolieren. Auch die Maskenpflicht bleibt mindestens bis Ende Februar in Kraft.
„Ich habe an vielen dunklen Tagen hier gestanden,aber heute ist ein guter Tag“, sagte Martin. Die Regierung werde die persönlichen Freiheiten nicht mehr beschränken, wenn dies nicht nötig sei. Irland habe den „Omikron-Sturm“ überstanden, sagte Martin. „Deshalb wird die Mehrheit der öffentlichen Gesundheitsmaßnahmen von 6.00 Uhr morgen früh an aufgehoben.“

THE TAOISEACH HAS said he would not rule out working with any party after the next election but accused Sinn Féin of being in “destructive opposition mode”.
Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin also said he found it extraordinary that the republican party had been “absolutely silent” on the Russian build-up of troops on the Ukrainian border, accusing it of being “anti-European Union”.
A number of opinion polls have seen Sinn Féin open up a clear lead as the most popular party in Ireland under leader Mary Lou McDonald.
Asked about whether he would be open to working with Sinn Féin after the next election, Martin said: “We will contest the election in our own right as a political party with our own policies and ideas and after that general election, we will consider, first of all, where we are in terms of our own seats and numbers of seats, and where others are.
“My sense of Sinn Féin at the moment is that it’s in a very destructive, resolute opposition mode, opposing everything that moves literally, politically.
“The level and range of what they’re promising is in the billions at this stage, and doesn’t, frankly, add up.
“A lot of their policies don’t add up, their housing policies don’t add up.”
The Taoiseach continued: “The other aspect of it that worries me a bit is their international, European policy.
“I think at heart, they’re still an anti-European Union party.

“I was struck in the Dail in the debate leading into the European Council, for example, they were absolutely silent on the massive Russian military build-up on the Ukraine (border).
“I found that extraordinary.
“I’ve noticed this for the last number of years, Sinn Féin will never criticise Russia, always remain silent.”
Martin predicted that the next Government in Ireland would not be easy to form.
He said: “There needs to be far greater focus on the actual substance of policy.
“Now, we managed to get agreement with the Greens and Fine Gael around fairly weighty topics, one being the climate change one, which has been a significant feature of government.
“All I’m simply putting to you is that the next government won’t be that easy to form, because it will have to be formed around policies and substance and issues and ideas.
“I’ll rule nobody out.
“I was simply pointing out that there are very substantive policy issues that go to the heart of what this country is about, and has been about for 50 years, and when I listen to Mary Lou (McDonald) she damns the last 50 years.
“So I believe that they would fatally undermine, with their current policies, the enterprise base of this in this country.”

He did not, however, draw attention to the fact that the review is overdue since 2015 and that its “imminent publication” has been frequently promised, most recently that it would be published “before Christmas “.
Our draconian defamation law has been a constraint on media freedom for many years and has been unfavourably commented on internationally by, among others, the European Court of Human Rights and the highly respected organisation Reporters Without Borders.
Defamation laws are an important measure to protect people’s rights, but when those laws threaten the very future of the media, the laws need to be reformed. Without an effective media, public debate is distorted and public discourse suffers.
Ireland’s ability to comment credibly, at the United Nations and elsewhere, on the absence of press freedom in other countries is severely constrained by the continuing failure to reform our defamation law.
Is it too much to hope that the much promised review and reform will in fact have taken place before President Biden’s second Summit for Democracy later this year? – Yours, etc,

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he is focusing on getting the work done rather than his future role in government at the end of next year.
Martin is set to hand over the post of Taoiseach to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar in December 2022, under the terms of the government deal agreed between the two traditional political rivals and the Green Party.
The historic deal followed a general election result in 2020 which saw Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael finish in an almost dead heat.
Varadkar is Tánaiste in the mixed government, which also includes Green Party leader Eamon Ryan.
Asked about the future government, Martin said his key focus is policy and “getting the work done”.
He said future ministerial posts will be considered closer to the time.
“When I became Taoiseach I was anxious that we would create structures that would enable us to deliver on the policy objectives within the programme for government,” he said.
“And to that extent we set up a fairly significant subcommittee structure within cabinet, particularly the key critical areas of housing, of climate, of economy, health, and education.
“And those committees are very important for not just getting into the fine detail of policy, but also following through and monitoring delivery.

“So my focus, and this is still early years in this government, is to really deliver now on the key commitments.
“We’ve made great progress, I would argue, so far. So I’m not speculating what’s going to happen in 12 months time in terms of specific ministries or anything like that, that would be a matter that would be considered closer to that time.”
Mr Martin said his ministers were “doing very well” and stressed the importance of consistency.
“I am of a view that consistency of policy and delivery is important,” he said.
“Chopping and changing all of the time might look good for a day or two, but nothing can beat the substance of getting real change.”
Martin described Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath as “very effective and solid”, working with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to take the economy through on of its largest upsets in 100 years.
“I think it’s the fastest recession we’ve had and deepest recession, but we’ve bounced back, along with our European colleagues, but in Ireland, we’ve bounced back very significantly,” he said.
“And so I think economically, the Government has done very well, in the context of a pandemic, fastest growing in Europe and quarter three employment almost back now above pre-pandemic levels.”
He described Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien as having put together a very comprehensive Housing for All strategy, with substance and funding, while he said Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has been “very, very effective”.
Martin described Norman Foley has having been a “very authoritative” Minister for Education, and commended Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly for presiding, he said, over one of the best vaccination programmes in Europe, if not across the globe.
The Taoiseach added: “People are only a year and a half in office and I think they’re all working very well, as are the ministers of state, all having significant legislation under their belt and getting important legislation passed, as well as initiatives particularly in mental health, older people and disabilities.”

In pre-Christmas remarks to reporters, Micheál Martin had said Sinn Féin will “never criticise Russia” and that there had been a “notable silence” from the party over a build-up of Russian military forces on the Ukrainian border.
He also said Sinn Féin was ""at heart . . . still an anti-European Union party"". However, speaking on Wednesday, Waterford TD and Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane said he would take no lectures from Micheál Martin and pushed back against the Taoiseach's suggestions.
""I'm certainly not going to take lectures from Micheál Martin or Fianna Fáil in relation to this issue or any issue if you look at the fact that they have reneged on their commitment to recognise the state of Palestine. "" He also said the Taoiseach had not said anything when political figures in Catalonia were imprisoned.
""Our track record on supporting people who are victims of human rights abuses, whether it's in Russia or anywhere else, is second to none. And I'm concerned as much as anybody else is about the build-up of troops in the Ukraine, but the reality is if there's debates the Taoiseach feels needs to be held on this issue, then why doesn't he organise them?"" Mr Cullinane said, rejecting the suggestion that the party is ""pro-Putin"".
On the party's EU stance, Mr Cullinane said it was not anti-EU but instead ""consistently railed against attempts to undermine the sovereignty of this State and to create structures in Europe that at times can be anti-democratic. A lot of people feel the same across Ireland so having what I would call critical engagement with the European Union is what we need to do.""
“I don’t see Sinn Féin as an anti-EU party, but certainly we have concerns about a continued and deepened federalism within the European Union and we’re certainly not alone on that across the European Union,” he said.
On Covid, the Sinn Féin health spokesman said it was clear there was no “magic solution” to the issues facing the country, but that he was taking encouragement from ICU figures which “seem to be holding up well and that’s the key figure that we need to look at”. However, he pointed out that there had been cancellation of non-urgent healthcare amid Covid pressures, and potentially of urgent healthcare in the coming weeks.
He also called for clear guidelines for schools for when teachers cannot come to school due to a positive Covid diagnosis.
“There is no magic solution here. I’m not going to say that there’s anything that can solve this problem overnight, we’re dealing with 20,000 cases per day so any system is going to become overwhelmed.” Amid what he termed “precariousness” on the supply of antigen tests, he said Sinn Féin in government would “engage directly with the companies that produce antigen tests and look at procurement either through EU level or in this State”.

THE NATIONAL PUBLIC Health Emergency Team (NPHET) have not recommended any new restrictions to the Government in its letter tonight.
The Journalunderstands that the public health team have advised the Government to not implement any additional restrictions.
There were 23,817 new cases of Covid-19 reported today, the highest ever reported in a single day.
As of 8am today, there are 941 people in hospital with Covid-19, of whom 90 are in ICU.
Patient numbers in ICU have remained relatively stable over recent days, with Taoiseach Micheál Martin saying earlier this week that the majority of patients in ICU have a case of the Delta variant, rather than a case of the Omicron variant.
Speaking yesterday, Martin said that that clinicians within the HSE have said that Omicron “is different” but that “it’s too early to be definitive about the connection between Omicron and admissions to ICU”.
HSE officials have said that there is “relentless strain” being placed on the healthcare service at the moment, due to high patient numbers and a significant amount of healthcare staff out sick with Covid-19.
Chief Executive of the HSE Paul Reid said that there are over 8,500 HSE staff currently off sick or restricting their movements due to Covid-19.

“From HSE perspective, we remain on kind of high alert in terms of the impacts, particularly that it’s [Omicron] having on the healthcare system overall, not just our hospitals,” said Reid.
“We are seeing literally persistent stress across the system overall, and particularly in the impacts of staff.”
There are approximately 8,500 healthcare workers out, including around 3,000 nurses and midwives as well as 1,500 health and social care staff.
However, there is no complete picture of the total number of staff out sick as current figures are based on a manual count carried out last week. He added that it could be double the manual count, and that 12.5% of the entire HSE may be off work due to Covid-19.
The HSE boss added that the level of absences were “very significant” compared to those witnessed in January last year.
The health service’s Chief Operations Officer, Anne O’Connor, told today’s briefing that staff absences are now affecting “everything we do”.
Current restrictions, which include an 8pm closing time for pubs and restaurants, as well as curbs on the number of people able to attend large events, areset to expire on 30 January.
It comes as the Government plans to update the Digital Covid Cert to reflect whether or not people have received a booster vaccine.
Updated certs are currently being issued and they will be required for travelling within the EU.

LAST UPDATE|5 Jan 2022
THE TAOISEACH HAS said there will be no change this week to rules for vaccinated close contacts but that the matter is to be discussed by NPHET when it meets tomorrow.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said yesterday he would favour people who have received a booster being exempted from the self-isolation rules, while Transport Minister Eamon Ryan also saying today that it “makes sense” to have different self-isolation rules depending on someone’s vaccination status.
The requirement of people to restrict movements is believed to be putting increasing pressure on different parts of the economy due topeople being unavailable for work.
At present, close contacts who have received a booster are required torestrict movements for five daysand undertake three antigen tests over several days.
Speaking after a Cabinet meeting today, Taoiseach Michéal Martin warned that making a change “too quickly” risked “accelerating even further the exponential growth of the virus”.
He said that certain sectors can apply for a derogation allowing them to be exempted from self-isolation rules. For example, healthcare workers are not required to self-isolate as a close contact if they test negative for Covid-19.
Education Minister Norma Foleysaid today she said she would not be seeking a similarderogation for teachers.
Martin said the five-day isolation advice was in line with other countries.
“First and foremost it’s public health advice and we’re not out of step internationally on this,” he said.
“We are always aware of challenges in certain parts of the economy. The button hasn’t been pressed in some areas in terms of derogations. That’s a matter that will be kept under constant review, this process of derogations.
“The public health advice will be kept under review by NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer they are aware, they’re very conscious of the impact of all of this on society but the key call here of course is not to do something too quickly that could accelerate even further the exponential growth of the virus.”
Martin said that the country was dealing with “a very rapid-spreading, highly transmissible variant” that needed to be managed.
Yesterday, an additional 21,302 newcases of Covid-19 were confirmed. As of yesterday, 884 people were in hospital with the virus, up 80, with 90 in ICU, down 3.

Hospital data shows that the bulk of Ireland’s sickest Covid-19 patients have the Delta variant and not the highly contagious Omicron strain.
The Taoiseach said that hospitals are “under pressure” with staff absences which is causing concerns.
He added that the severity of the Omicron variant must be monitored over the course of the next 10 days, with “the bulk of ICU” cases still made up of people who had been infected with the Delta variant.
Martin said that that clinicians within the HSE have said that Omicron “is different” but that “it’s too early to be definitive about the connection between Omicron and admissions to ICU”.
He added: “There will be challenging number of weeks in January, the next week or 10 days will give us more evidence in terms of the impact of this variant on severity of illness and that will inform decisions, public health advice will be given giving in respect to a broad range of issues, not least the issue of close contacts.”
Antiviral drugs
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly also confirmed today that Ireland is pursuing the purchase of Covid-19 antiviral and monoclonal antibody treatments.
Ireland will seek to purchase treatments manufactured by Pfizer, Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck (MSD).
The EU Commission is currently progressing a Joint Procurement Agreement (JPA) in relation to antivirals, which includes MSD’s Lagevrio (Molnupiravir) and Pfizer’s Paxlovid (Ritonavir), and Ireland has formally indicated its intention to participate in this arrangement.
Ireland is already a participant in an EU JPA for the purchase of the GSK monoclonal antibody product Xevudy (Sotrovimab).
The HSE, in consultation with the Department of Health, is also exploring opportunities to procure antivirals through bilateral agreements at national level, in advance of the completion of the relevant EU JPA.
Foreign travel
The Taoiseach today also confirmed that testing requirements for vaccinated people entering Ireland from abroad are to be lifted, as the measures were introduced before Christmas to stem the spread of the Omicron variant, which now makes up 96% of cases.
The Taoiseach said the change will be made “in the next couple of days”, meaning anyone flying inbound in the next few days will likely still need a negative test to enter Ireland.
Martin also confirmed that his government had granted approval to buy antiviral Covid pills, and argued that the current restrictions in place are “effective”.

An Taoiseach was speaking to reporters after a Cabinet meeting where ministers discussed the “rampant” spread of Covid-19 but no further restrictions have yet been recommended by public health officials. NPHET are due to meet tomorrow.
The Taoiseach also defended the government’s decision to open schools as planned tomorrow, saying that they were putting the child’s needs first.
Minister for Education Norma Foley said yesterday there was no rationale to delay tomorrow’s return of schools butunions have continued to express concern about the availability of teachersdue to Covid-related absences.
Speaking to reporters today, Martin said that “children do best when at school” and that this was the motivation behind the decision to proceed with the reopening of education.
He added: “It’s been a long pandemic, we had Delta in autumn and now Omicron. And I think people responded very well indeed and I think that will be reflected. NPHET will meet on Thursday and we we’ll be steady as she goes now in relation to dealing with this.”
Also speaking outside Government Buildings, Transport minister and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said he does not see any additional Covid-19 restrictions being put in place in the short term.
Ryan, Martin and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar met yesterday ahead of today’s Cabinet meeting.
“The numbers are huge, the cases, but the critical numbers are the numbers in critical care and they have held relatively steady,” Ryan said today.

Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath also said further restrictions are not expected following today’s Cabinet meeting.
“As of today the government does not have any indication that NPHET intend to bring forward additional restrictions on the economy or on society,” he said.
McGrath said that “nobody knows for sure” when the peak of the Omicron wave would come and the government must remain “cautious and careful”.

,Introduction of mandatory vaccination ruled out by Taoiseach,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has ruled out the introduction of mandatory vaccination against Covid-19 in Ireland. Mr Martin’s comments to reporters in Cork on Monday afternoon follow reports that Nphet is to consider the issue, with a new paper being prepared by the Department of Health on the legal and ethical aspects of such a move. Mr Martin said that while Nphet could “examine every issue”, Ireland had a very high rate of vaccination through a voluntary system, and that would be continued. “I have been very clear in that I favour the voluntary approach to vaccination. In fact, we have...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/introduction-of-mandatory-vaccination-ruled-out-by-taoiseach-1.4773139?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-01-10T17:20:09+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has ruled out the introduction of mandatory vaccination against Covid-19 in Ireland, saying he favours a voluntary approach.
“I fully respect that people will explore all issues and research them. But from my perspective we have achieved one of the highest rates [of vaccination] in the world through a voluntary system. That is the system that we will maintain,” he told reporters in Cork.
Mr Martin’s comments follows reports that National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is to consider the issue, with a new paper being prepared by the Department of Health on the legal and ethical aspects of such a move.
The Taoiseach said he was confident that further restrictions could be avoided.
“That said, we want to give it another week or two. We haven’t peaked yet,” he said.
“Covid has had many twists and turns, but I am confident that if we maintain the same focus we can get through the wave.”
He added he was very conscious of the impact of the 8pm closure on the hospitality sector but does not foresee any immediate easing on the cut-off time.
His comments came as the Department of Health reported 23,909 new cases bringing the total recorded in Ireland to 1,002,013 since February 2020.
As of 8am on Monday, there were 1,063 patients in the country’s hospitals with the virus, with 89 of those in intensive care.
In Northern Ireland, the death of six patients who had previously tested positive for the virus and another 2,706 cases were notified on Monday.
Mr Martin said that while Nphet could “examine every issue”, Ireland had a very high rate of vaccination through a voluntary system.
“We have done extraordinarily well as a country. There is a 94 per cent vaccination rate for the first and second doses,” Mr Martin said.
“There is a 63 per cent rate for the booster. I think that speaks volumes for informing the public of the benefits of vaccination and also the robust debate that has taken place with strong medical and public health contributions - not just from officialdom but from those within the academic world, those involved in medicine who have been very, very clear about the benefits of vaccination,” Mr Martin said.
Earlier, senior Government sources strongly pushed back on the idea of mandatory vaccination.
“This will never be on the table for the Government,” said one high-ranking source.
Other sources agreed that with among the highest vaccination rates in the world, the voluntary approach was already working well in Ireland. “Why would we even consider this?”
According to Nphet minutes, details of which were published by The Irish Times on Monday, the issue of mandatory vaccination will be discussed once the Department of Health had produced a paper on the issue.
Among other EU countries, Austria has announced it will introduce mandatory vaccination, while the measure is also under consideration in Germany.
Mr Martin said it was “vital” people continued to support the vaccination programme.
“There are still people out there who could get vaccinated and who haven’t got the booster yet.
“It is very, very important that they get the booster - that’s the key measure that people can take to prevent themselves from being hospitalised or being admitted to ICU.”
He added that he fully respected and understood the pressures that many different sectors of the economy are under but emphasised that we need to “keep the pressure on the virus.”
“We have to ensure that it does not spread too widely, too quickly.”
Also on Monday, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan encouraged parents and their children to avail of the Covid-19 vaccination programme.
“Getting your child vaccinated is a decision between you and your child,” he said in a statement.
“I would encourage all parents and guardians to discuss this update to our vaccination programme with your child and ensure that they are aware that vaccination is available to them.”
“Most children will experience a very mild form of this disease, for a small few, they may become severely ill. The Covid-19 vaccines are doing an excellent job of preventing severe illness and disease in those who are fully vaccinated.”

In a televised address from Government Buildings last night, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that while he had often delivered bad news from there in the past, “today is a good day”.
Earlier, at a special Cabinet meeting, Ministers agreed to immediately apply advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) which had told the Government there was no longer a public health rationale for the continuation of most restrictions.
From 6am this morning, the great majority of public health restrictions will be discontinued. Pubs and restaurants will be able to return to normal opening hours today, while nightclubs will be permitted to open tonight, though most will need to obtain a late licence from the courts and will not open until Wednesday.
The rules limiting attendances at all indoor and outdoor events are discontinued, meaning that major sporting events will proceed with full capacity. The requirement for digital Covid certificates is also gone. A phased return to the office will begin on Monday.
However, some rules will remain in place. Mask wearing will still be required in all settings where it is currently enforced until February 28th. There are no changes to the current measures in place for travel, while the advice for those with symptoms, positive cases and close contacts remains in place. The remaining measures will be reviewed by the end of February.
At an upbeat press conference following his televised address Mr Martin said: “Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as this one . . . As we look forward to this spring, we need to see each other again.”
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar announced a number of changes to the business and worker supports, culminating in their phasing out in the first half of the year.
A planned reduction in the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme payments to employers will be postponed until March but the support will be wound down gradually after that. The pandemic unemployment payment will be closed for new applicants today and phased out over the next two months.
Mr Varadkar said there will be “no cliff edge” but there will have to be an end to the payments.He also said that workers who do not wish to return to the office have no automatic right to remain working at home. “If your contract of employment says that you are required to work in a particular location, then that’s your contractual obligation,” he said.
Minister for Arts Catherine Martin said there will be a St Patrick’s Day parade in Dublin this year and there is €2 million in funding for it.
Both the Taoiseach and State chief medical officer Tony Holohan stressed the pandemic was “not over”. However, asked if the public health emergency was over, Mr Martin replied “yes, the emergency is over in terms of those restrictions”. He said that the Government would seek to “embed into the health system” the capacity to deal with future outbreaks or new variants.
Dr Holohan said an increase in case numbers could be expected as restrictions are lifted, a trend that he said had been seen in other countries. But he said that Nphet had “dialled that in in the advice we have given to Government”. He stressed the “critical importance of staying out of circulation when you have symptoms”.
There will not be another meeting of Nphet for another four weeks, he said. Some senior public health figures agree the time may be coming to move away from the Nphet structure – to “thank people for their efforts”, said one , with the return to the workplace an “ideal time for that”.
Mr Martin was careful to warn that “we may have to come back again” with further restrictions if new variants emerge or the situation deteriorates but the mood in Government Buildings suggested that Ministers believe the era of onerous restrictions is now finished.
Hospitality businesses greeted the news with enthusiasm. The Vintners’ Federation of Ireland (VFI), which represents pubs outside Dublin, said that “pubs can get back to the business of what they do best – serving the public in a warm, safe and friendly environment”.
“The removal of all restrictions this weekend is the green light for pubs to get back to doing what they do best and I know for a fact they can’t wait,” said VFI chief executive Pádraig Cribben.

,State will have to ‘reflect’ on military non-alignment policy in future – Taoiseach,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said Ireland will have to “reflect” on its long-standing policy of military non-alignment in future European conflicts, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine escalated with an attack on a nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia. Mr Martin’s comments come ahead of a meeting of European leaders next week which is likely to discuss a new departure for European defence, raising questions for Ireland’s traditional policy of military neutrality. “We are not neutral in respect of what’s happening in Ukraine,” Mr Martin told journalists in Limerick. “As members...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/state-will-have-to-reflect-on-military-non-alignment-policy-in-future-taoiseach-1.4818776?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-03-05T01:41:00+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said Ireland will have to “reflect” on its long-standing policy of military non-alignment in future European conflicts, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine escalated with an attack on a nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia.
Mr Martin’s comments come ahead of a meeting of European leaders next week which is likely to discuss a new departure for European defence, raising questions for Ireland’s traditional policy of military neutrality.
“We are not neutral in respect of what’s happening in Ukraine,” Mr Martin told journalists in Limerick.
“As members of the UN Security Council, we uphold the values of self-determination, territorial integration and the sovereignty of people, and we believe in defending those values, and that is why as a country we have been full lock-step with our European colleagues on the sanctions and also in facilitating the deployment of the European Peace Facility – for the first time it has been used at a European-wide level for the deployment of lethal weapons to the defence of Ukraine, whereas up to now [it] was used for the deployment of non-lethal weapons.”
Mr Martin said Ireland has “already evolved” its neutrality policy within the European Union “by participating in Pesco [Permanent Structured Cooperation] . . . and also in terms of threats around cybersecurity, and peace enforcement missions under the EU umbrella”.
“I think the important point I would make is that this war does necessitate reflection on all of that, but it should be of a more deliberate kind,” he said, responding to questions on whether the Government was considering joining Nato and if Europe was pressing Ireland to join.
Mr Martin said discussions around Ireland and Nato were “for another day”, yet he acknowledged that while Ireland was presently “focused” on supporting sanctions against Russia and sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine, “President Putin’s assault on Ukraine threatens the world order and that does cause and is an occasion for reflection”.
Meanwhile, a total of 621 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine have arrived in Ireland as of Friday, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs.
A little over a week after Russia invaded its neighbouring country, it is estimated that more than 1.2 million Ukrainians have crossed the borders seeking sanctuary.
If the war continues to escalate and continues into the medium term, Ireland will be expected to host about 2 per cent of all refugees who have been forced to leave their home country.
On that basis, the Government has begun scenario planning based on a minimum of 20,000 Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland.
Speaking on Friday afternoon, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said he would not be surprised if the figure coming in would easily exceed 1,000 by next week.
Mr Martin has said Ireland had to prepare for the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis facing Europe since the second World War.
Government sources said it was not expected that a large number of refugees would arrive in Ireland in the coming weeks and the figure of 600 fell within expectations.
There are an estimated 4,000 Ukrainian-born people living in Ireland at present and, in the initial stages, Ukrainian refugees arriving into Ireland will go to relatives.
A source said virtually all of the 621 people who have arrived have support networks of family and friends in Ireland and have not sought any help from the State so far.
The vast majority of the 1.2 million people who have fled the country have gone to neighbouring countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romanian and Moldova, and also to Germany and Israel where there are large expatriate populations.

,Calls for consumer watchdog to investigate alleged fuel price gouging,"Politicians are calling on Ireland’s consumer watchdog to investigate alleged fuel price gouging amid rises in the cost of petrol and diesel ahead of the cut in excise duties. Excise cuts of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent on diesel kicked in from midnight as part of Government efforts to mitigate spiralling fuel costs happening as a result of the war in Ukraine. However, there have been claims that fuel companies hiked the price just before the excise cut and suggestions that prices are still rising. Taoiseach Micheál Martin told Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party meeting on...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/calls-for-consumer-watchdog-to-investigate-alleged-fuel-price-gouging-1.4823415?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-03-10T10:51:24+00:00,"Ireland’s consumer watchdog has said there are “no legal barriers” to petrol stations independently increasing prices and it does not have a role in monitoring such increases.
The statement from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) comes after politicians called for it to investigate alleged price-gouging by fuel companies.
Excise cuts of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent on diesel kicked in from midnight as part of Government efforts to mitigate a sharp increase in fuel costs linked to the war in Ukraine.
However, there have been claims that some fuel providers hiked prices just before the excise cut as well as suggestions that prices are still rising.
Government and Opposition politicians have called for a CCPC investigation.
The CCPC indicated, though, that it requires evidence of cartel behaviour before it would launch an investigation.
In a statement it said that “there are no legal barriers to petrol stations acting independently to increase their prices”.
“The CCPC does not have a role in monitoring price increases in the market.
“If businesses collude to fix prices this is cartel behaviour and the CCPC can investigate and refer a case to the DPP for criminal prosecution.”
It said further information on cartels and how the public can submit evidence to the CCPC is available on its website.
In a subsequent statement the organisation said said it had received 33 contacts in relation to the pricing practices of service stations since the start of 2022 and 29 of these have been received in the last 48 hours.
“Of the 33, 27 contacts relate to pricing practices by service stations and refer specifically to increases in the price of fuel,” it said.
“These contacts have been forwarded to our Competition Enforcement and Mergers Division where they will be examined as part of the complaint screening process.”
Earlier, the Minister of State for Consumer Protection Robert Troy encouraged people to report any evidence of cartel behaviour.
He said his officials are working with the CCPC to ensure consumers are aware of their rights and businesses are aware of their obligations.
“If any consumer has evidence of cartel behaviour or abuse of dominance with regards to high fuel costs, they should contact the CCPC who can investigate,” Mr Troy added.
Representatives of the sector said it could be a number of days before the cut in excise is reflected in the price at the pumps.
Kevin McPartlan, chief executive of industry body Fuels for Ireland, said the reduction in excise has had ""some impact"" but it won't be felt by many just yet.
“Excise is payable at the point at which they leave the terminal and it’s paid in advance a lot of the time. So the fuels stored in the forecourts, and being used today, had already paid the higher rate of excise,” he said. “They have to get rid of the stock they bought at the higher excise before prices come down.”
Mr McPartlan denied claims that filling stations were price-gouging or profiteering ahead of the excise reduction, adding that the allegations were “so far from the truth”.
Anna Cullen, spokeswoman with AA Ireland, said some filling stations had dropped prices but that it was “mixed” overall and up to individual forecourts to decide.
However, Ms Cullen said even if prices come down in the coming days, these would still be among the highest since the AA began recording data in 1991. She said she expected further increases in the weeks ahead.
Laois-Offaly TD Barry Cowen has written to the CCPC saying he is concerned some retailers may be engaging in ""price gouging"".
“Photos have been shared on social media of the high cost of petrol and diesel per litre, with assertions being made that the cost increased dramatically overnight – sometimes apparently by the sum of the planned Government reduction in excise duty,” he wrote.
A spokeswoman for Applegreen service stations welcomed the temporary reduction in fuel excise duties, but said they “do not go far enough to mitigate completely the cost price increases we have experienced as a result of unprecedented volatility in the wholesale fuel market”.
Separately, in a statement issued to The Irish Times, Circle K denied it was artificially inflating prices at any of its forecourts around Ireland in order to take advantage of the excise cuts.
“We categorically refute claims that price changes across petrol and diesel were implemented as a result of [THE]Government announcement regarding the reduction in excise duty,” a spokesman said.
“Our pricing is set in line with local and international market movements and wholesale market costs. This was the case today and the same process is adhered to anytime there are price changes,” he continued.
He stressed that the current climate was ‘unprecedented” and stressed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was having a “significant impact and leading to price pressures which is a challenge for all fuel retailers.”
He said Circle K was “continuously focused on delivering the very best value for our customers, however the current level of volatility within global markets driven by intense demand is posing a major challenge for everyone in the sector”
The company’s spokesman concluded by saying Circle K was committed to passing on any reductions to the cost of refined petrol and diesel products globally although he warned that it was likely there would be further “pressure on prices in the coming weeks”.
Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the Taoiseach was working with EU colleagues at a summit in France on the issue of taxes on energy in an attempt to find ways to help consumers handle rising fuel costs.
The Minister was responding to Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty, who called for further cuts to excise duties. Mr Doherty said the reduction announced by the Government had been “immediately eroded” and that “prices are going to continue to go up and up”.
“You need to understand that people are panicking and they need support from Government,” Mr Doherty said.
Mr Ryan acknowledged people were “very upset” this morning, as they were looking at forecourts and seeing that the price of petrol and diesel had not changed. The problem, he said, was that this price was probably set when fuels were bought ahead of the excise reduction.
Mr Doherty also said that people “don’t need to be told to slow down, they’re telling you hurry up, get your act together and get these prices down further”. This was a reference to Mr Ryan on Wednesday saying people should drive more slowly as a practical step to reduce their fuel consumption.
On Thursday, The Minister said: “That advice to slow down got a lot of criticism yesterday, but it was an answer to a straight question; what are the sort of efficiency measures we could do and it’s just a fact.”
Mr Ryan said if a person travelling on a motorway went from 120 km/h down to 100km/h they could save “about 20 per cent plus”. “That’s real, that’s absolute law of physics and that measure is also important.”
Speaking in the Dáil, Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd called for “dawn raids” on fuel companies. He said petrol dealers are challenging the authority of the Government “by not passing on the full discount in many cases to consumers”.
He also said the public “need to flood the CCPC with complaints because they will only act if they have those complaints”.
Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore said she had written to the CCPC asking it to launch an investigation.

,Early entry to EU for Ukraine championed by Martin at EU summit,"Ireland has argued forcibly to accelerate Ukraine’s accession to the EU at a special summit of European leaders in France. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he spoke strongly in favour of the Union facilitating Ukraine’s pathway to early membership at a meeting of the 27 leaders in the Palace of Versailles. “The enlargement process has been too slow over the past decade in relation to countries in the neighbourhood of the EU,” Mr Martin said. “Geopolitically it is important.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he spoke strongly in favour of the Union facilitating Ukraine’s pathway to early membership at a meeting of the 27 leaders in the Palace of Versailles.
“The enlargement process has been too slow over the past decade in relation to countries in the neighbourhood of the EU,” Mr Martin said.
“Geopolitically it is important. The world is polarising between authoritarian states and dictators, and democracies that cherish basic values and freedom of speech.”
He said there was no better way to demonstrate that than to allow Ukraine early accession.
“Those who are fighting now, they are fighting for the children’s future and they want that future to be in a democratic Europe.
“There was an emotionally compelling presentation by quite a number of States: the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary and others on the border of Ukraine,” he said.
However, no decisions were taken as it was an informal meeting.
Mr Martin also conceded that some member states were not in favour of changing the current process.
Speaking to reporters at the end of the two-day meeting which was hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron, Mr Martin gave a downbeat assessment of the current situation in Ukraine.
“There are no major prospects of an end to the war. Clearly the human toll and suffering and death is increasing,” he said.
“There is considerable concern for the latter part of this year that this war and the shock it has created across the economic and financial systems of the world could impact on economic growth and that is a big concern.”
He criticised Russia’s call for a meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations on chemical weapons as a “cynical move”, and Russian president Vladimir Putin for allowing Russia to commit war crimes.
Addressing his remarks to Mr Putin directly, he said: “You are responsible for this war. You are guilty of war crimes. We are saying Stop the War. Stop playing games with people’s lives.
“We are saying it out front. There is no hiding place. We can’t play games with people’s lives.”
Mr Martin said the war was following previous patterns of Russian attacks where civilian areas were targeted, as happened in Chechnya and Syria.
He said the EU countries close to Russia were gravely concerned about where President Putin might go next.
“They don’t believe he will stop at Ukraine, hence their sense, and the EU sense, that a robust response has to be delivered by the EU in the form of very strong economic sanctions.”
He said wider sanctions would be formally discussed at a Council meeting at the end of March, which will see firmer measures being announced.
Turning to energy, he said the EU Commission may decide by the end of the month on the Government’s appeal for more flexibility over energy prices, something that would allow further reductions in VAT to consumers in Ireland.
Asked if he could envisage a need for the rationing of fuel, food or commodities, Mr Martin said he did not see it at this stage but added the war could get worse. He said there were already issues with food and commodities such as steel and paper.
Projected economic growth had already been adjusted downwards by half of one per cent.
In the discussion on defence it was agreed that Europe was behind in terms of security with gaps in its preparedness.
Mr Martin said there were also gaps in the capability of Irish Defence Forces, but that that has been apparent for some time. It applied to all three arms, he said: naval; air; and land.

“On March 17, President Joe Biden will host Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, for a bilateral meeting and Shamrock presentation at the White House, continuing a longstanding St. Patrick’s Day tradition,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in astatementissued on Sunday.

This war on civilians must end” – the words of Taoiseach Micheál Martin responding to reports of a strike on a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol.
Mr Martin will today travel to an informal European Union summit in Versailles where the Russian invasion of Ukraine will unsurprisingly dominate the agenda.
The discussions will focus on the EU’s response to the refugee crisis, how to rapidly eliminate Europe’s dependence on Russian gas imports, as well as the security threats posed by the invasion.
As European leaders assemble the horrors of the war continue unabated.
Daniel McLaughlinreports in our leadon how Ukraine has pleaded with the West to help protect its skies after blaming Russia for a bomb strike that gutted the maternity hospital.
Footage from Mariupol showed a maternity home and children’s hospital in ruins and pregnant women being carried out stretchers. Local officials said at least 17 people were injured.
""Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!"" tweeted Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelenskiy.
“How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets.""
In terms of the international response the United Nations spokesman called for ""an immediate halt to attacks on healthcare, hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulances – none of these should ever, ever be a target"".
Nato meanwhile, has rebuffed Ukraine's requests for a no-fly zone over the country, amid concerns that it could cause a direct clash between the western alliance and Russia.
More broadly in the war fighting raged outside major cities including the capital Kyiv, fears grew for the safety of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant after its electricity supply failed, and Ukrainians continued to join a westward flow of more than 2.2 million displaced people.
EU leaders will have a lot to talk about when they gather outside Paris today.
Those living under Russian bombardment in Ukraine will be more interested in what more action they will take to try and stop the war.
Back home the war is adding to the woes of households who had already been struggling with the cost of living. A cut in excise on petrol and diesel kicked in at midnight but ministers fear that the tax reductions will be wiped out by soaring price rises.
Opposition TDs complained that the reductions – by 20 cent a litre for petrol and 15 cent for diesel – were not enough, while the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that the Government ""cannot protect citizens and businesses from the entire cost impact. We are experiencing the consequences of a war"".
The cuts in excise, which will expire in August, will cost the exchequer €320 million.
Petrol and diesel prices in Ireland are at their highest level on record with the current average just under €2 per litre. Were the average prices seen this week to continue over 12 months it would mean fuel costs for the average motorist would be €1,000 higher than in 2020.
The issue of course got an airing at both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings.
There were calls from Fine Gael backbenchers to stall planned increases to the carbon tax, due to start in May – with excise cuts dismissed as “too little, too late”.
Pat Leahy, Harry McGee, Conor Pope and Jack Horgan-Jones have the storyhere.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin starts his St Patrick’s Day trip to Washington DC today with a series of events in the US Capitol.
His programme today will focus on tourist and cultural links with the USA.
It’s the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic there has been in-person celebration of St Patrick’s Day here and with a US President unashamedly proud of his Irish heritage.
This morning the Taoiseach will address the traveling media before unveiling a bust of John Hume at the residence of the Irish ambassador.
This evening he’s attending a gala dinner put on by Tourism Ireland, typically used to press the flesh with Irish business in the States.
After that he’ll attend the opening night of the Riverdance 25th anniversary show, something also delayed by the pandemic.
A number of Oireachtas members have also traveled to Ireland, meeting US counterparts last night.
But amid the usually gladhandling the war in Ukraine will overshadow events here and while the links between Ireland and the US are being celebrated, it’s in the context of how they’ll be needed in the weeks and months to come as sanctions bite and rockets continue to be fired.

,"Northern Ireland Protocol needs ‘significant changes’, Johnson tells Martin",British prime minister Boris Johnson has told Taoiseach Micheál Martin that “significant changes” are still needed with the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol after Mr Martin said there is an increasing view that it is working.

Mr Johnson met with Mr Martin in London where the pair discussed Ukraine and the protocol before watching Ireland beat England in the Six Nations at Twickenham.
Mr Johnson told Mr Martin that he hopes the ""same spirit of co-operation"" the UK and EU have shared during the Ukraine crisis can be applied to Brexit discussions.
A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""The Prime Minister reiterated the need to make significant changes to the Northern Ireland protocol in order to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and safeguard the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions.
“He said that while greater ambition and flexibility was needed from the EU in the negotiations, it was his hope that the same spirit of co-operation that had characterised the UK/EU relationship in respect of Ukraine could also be applied to resolving the issues with the protocol.”
A spokesperson for the Taoiseach said: “The Taoiseach welcomed the ongoing engagement between the EU and UK on issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol and highlighted the importance of reaching durable, practical solutions for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.”
The protocol has created new economic barriers on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.
Agreed by the UK and EU to ensure no hardening of the Irish land border post-Brexit, it has instead moved regulatory and customs checks to the Irish Sea, with Northern Ireland remaining in the EU single market for goods.
The region also applies the EU customs code at its ports.
Unionists and loyalists claim the arrangements have undermined the sovereignty of the UK and have demanded the UK triggers the protocol’s Article 16 mechanism to suspend its trading provisions.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said on Friday he will not go back into the Stormont Executive until the matter of the protocol is dealt with.
Earlier on Saturday, Mr Martin said everyone he has met in Northern Ireland wants continued access to the EU single market.
Mr Martin was asked what the Irish government’s communication channels were like with the DUP and how likely it is that the issue of the Northern Ireland protocol will be resolved by the time of upcoming elections.
Speaking to reporters at the Embassy of Ireland in London, Mr Martin said the Irish government has good channels of communication with all parties in Northern Ireland.
He said: “What’s very interesting from our perspective though is that what’s increasing and growing is a view within Northern Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland business and industry, that the protocol is working in terms of inward investment into Northern Ireland, and in terms of access to the EU single market.
“So anybody I’ve met in Northern Ireland all want to continue access to the EU single market. It’s a good basic principle to start off on. And my view, given the improved relationship between the UK and the EU as a result of the partnership on Ukraine, I would like to think that in the fullness of time we will be able to resolve this issue.
""But we'll take it step by step. And there's a channel there between the European Union and the United Kingdom that's ongoing and we're going to take this step by step.""
Mr Donaldson was applauded at Crossgar Orange Hall on Friday night as he said his party would not re-enter the Stormont Executive until the Government acts to ""protect Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom"".
Paul Givan resigned as first minister earlier this year as part of the DUP's action against the protocol in a move which also removed deputy first minister Michelle O'Neill from the joint office. – PA

MICHEÁL MARTIN HAS said commodity prices are “going through the roof” as he warned people to expect an economic impact from Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The Taoiseach said the conflict will affect how much products cost and said a possible shortage of grain will have “very serious repercussions”.
Ireland is heavily reliant on imported grain, with around 60% of the 5.5 million tonnes used in the country every year sourced from overseas.
It is used both in products for human consumption and for animal feed.
Ukraine and Russia are both key international exporters of grain.
Russia also supplies more than 20% of fertiliser used in Ireland.
Martin, who was speaking to reporters during a visit to London, said the precise impact of the war is yet to be determined.
Asked how concerned he is about the shortage of certain products, he said: “I think Europe is capable of feeding itself.
“I think there will be a very significant issue around grain, and it looks very likely Ukraine will not be planting this season.
“That has very serious repercussions across the continent, which will impact on Ireland, and that’s why there’s been discussions with Irish farming organisations.
“We have to be honest with people too, the war will have an impact.
“The precise nature of that impact is yet to be determined, but commodity prices are going through the roof basically.”
Martin said this will feed into the economy, with the three main areas being fuel prices, food and general commodities.

The Taoiseach said there will be an impact on food but said he was not clear yet about any specific issues around shortages.
Pressed on potential shortages of particular products and lack of choice, Mr Martin said: “I don’t want to scaremonger at this stage.
“I’m just not in a position to predict this. But I want to say to people though, the war will impact on us, particularly in terms of prices of many products, and that’s probably the earliest manifestation of the war through food and everything else,” he said.
Asked if the country is in a “war economy”, he replied: “Not quite yet but we’re heading into that direction.”
Diesel prices
Meanwhile, the French government has announced a package worth €2 billion to help consumers struggling with soaring fuel prices.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex announced yesterday evening that petrol and diesel prices would be reduced by 15c per litre.
The bill will be slashed by this amount when vehicle owners pay, with the state then reimbursing gas station owners for the difference.
“That means every time you fill up for €60, you save around €9,” Castex said.
With petrol prices now topping  €2 per litre at the pump in some areas, the government has come under pressure to reduce the impact on households.
It has also been under pressure to cut fuel taxes ahead of presidential elections next month, with more than half of prices at the pump made up of taxation.
Underlying petrol and diesel costs are linked to global oil markets which have risen by around 30% since the start of the year due to strong global demand and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Last October, the government of President Emmanuel Macron announced a cap on gas and electricity prices until the end of 2022 and handed out cheques to poor households to help them with their domestic energy bills.

In the Dáil, Taoiseach Micheál Martin hit back at the Opposition criticisms, insisting that the Government understands the pressure families are facing and promising to “do more” to tackle the problem.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said households have been “hammered by a cost-of-living crisis that is out of control” and are being “crucified by the extortionate cost of housing, of energy, of fuel, of groceries, of insurance”.
But Mr Martin warned that the Government “can’t chase inflation”, and said that Sinn Féin proposals to cut VAT to ease pressure on households would mean that an EU derogation that enabled a lower VAT rate would be lost permanently.
But he said: “We’ve got to cushion the blow . . . for those most in hardship, those most at risk.
“We’ve got to target the measures and the Government is currently examining ways to do just that. That’s what we intend to do and to alleviate people more generally in terms of these pressures.”
He said the Government has a number of measures under consideration on cost of living and indicated that they would be announced later this week.
Ms McDonald accused the Government of “mañana, mañana” and “dither and delay” and reiterated her call for the planned increase in carbon tax due in May to be scrapped.
But Mr Martin said the Government would not abandon plans to increase carbon tax this year, insisting that it was a necessary move to tackle carbon emissions and climate change.
Earlier, Opposition parties had demanded a mini-budget and an increase in the minimum wage to ease the pressure of the cost-of-living crisis.
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said: ""Tinkering at the edges is not going to deal with this.
“If you’re going to do something that is targeted and meaningful, I think it is probably going to be in the area of a mini-budget.”
She suggested measures, such as an increased minimum wage and extending the fuel allowance for people on the working family payment scheme, were needed to help workers on lower incomes.
Labour finance spokesman Ged Nash also called for a commitment to a finance or social welfare Bill in response to the crisis and suggested a cut in VAT on fuel and energy costs.
He said a mini-budget should be implemented “if the package that is to be presented is going to be meaningful”.
Solidarity TD Mick Barry said he will be introducing a Dáil motion on Wednesday calling for an increase in the minimum wage to €15 per hour.
Meanwhile, the Taoiseach has said the views of Fianna Fáil junior minister Seán Fleming, who said in a radio interview on Monday that people should shop around to get better value for money amid the cost-of-living crisis, were ""not the view of Ministers, and it's not a privately held view either"".
“People do different things to try to make ends meet, people already do everything possible to reduce expenditures,” Mr Martin said.
Mr Fleming later apologised for his remarks but his comments were seized on by Opposition parties in the Dáil, with Ms McDonald saying that the “callous and indifferent remarks from a minister who’s paid €140,000 [a year] . . . reflect the attitude of a Government that is utterly out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people”.
Green leader Eamon Ryan said that ""shopping between different suppliers is another way in which people can look to see how to bring their bills down. I think there's a whole variety of measures we all need to look at.""

REACHING IRELAND’S TARGET for generating 80% of electricity from renewable sources will depend on developing “offshore wind technologies”, the Taoiseach told an international ocean summit today.
A group of world leaders met in Brest on France’s Atlantic coast this morning for a three-day One Ocean summit.
Discussions focused on how to protect oceans from threats such as overfishing and plastic pollution, as well as the links between oceans and climate change.
Speaking at the summit, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that “right now Ireland consumes electricity that’s up to 43% generated by renewables”.
“Our target to 2030 is to get to 80% and that will be dependent on the offshore wind technologies from now to then,” the Taoiseach said.
The 2021 Climate Action Plan increased the target for the proportion of electricity that must come from renewable sources by the end of the decade.
A target set two years previously for 70% of electricity to be generated from renewable sources was raised to “up to 80%” by 2030.

“We have moved quickly to create a new legislative framework around a streamlined permitting system in terms of consents and so forth. That legislation has passed,” he said.
“We’re creating a new regulatory agency to govern the development of offshore wind and renewables, five gigawatts to 2030 but excessively beyond that then for post-2030 so that we get into a stage where we will be exporting energy.
“We are developing interconnection, we will soon have interconnection with France and with Wales and we see that as our future to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”
He alluded to recent discussions on how the growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine highlight much ofEurope’s dependence on Russia for gas.
Though Ireland does not rely on Russia for gas, a disruption elsewhere in the EU could raise prices here.
“If we look at the geopolitical situation at the moment, part of our vulnerability, and certainly from an Irish perspective, is our dependence on imported fossil fuels,” Martin said.
“Our way out of that dependence is the development of offshore wind,” he said, adding “green hydrogen and greater storage capacity as well”.
Oceans cover more than 70% of the planet’s surface.
In his opening speech, French President Emmanuel Macron said that “today, we are going to make commitments” and that he was “convinced they are going to help strengthen helpful actions”.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was among in-person attendees at the event, along with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, which is set to host the COP27 climate summit in November.
US special envoy for climate John Kerry and several other African and European leaders attended the event in person, while others participated through video messages.
Kerry said “the urgency of the plight within which we all find ourselves” deserves attention.
He said there are “large-scale, extraordinary operations that go on every single day at sea that are indistinguishable from major criminal enterprises on land”.
“They use appalling practices of labour, money laundering and fraud to destroy the good efforts of fisher people around the world who are trying to live by the rules.”
In a joint statement today, the US and France recognised “the transboundary aspects of plastic pollution and the importance of curbing it at its source”.
The statement said the countries support launching negotiations at the upcoming UN Environment Assembly to reach a global agreement addressing the issue.

Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin interacted with PresidentJoe Biden, 79, and House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, 81, on Wednesday night shortly before he tested positive for COVID-19.
Biden's contact with Martin, however, did not fall under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for a 'close contact,' a White House communications aide told DailyMail.com.
The official, however, declined to answer whether the president was tested yet forcoronavirus.
The exposure to the president and speaker happened during the Ireland Funds National Gala on Wednesday evening at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.
Martin, 61, was scheduled to attend a day of events Thursday at the White House in celebration of St. Patrick's Day. Biden is of Irish descent.
A spokesperson for Martin said: 'He is feeling well and is currently self isolating on public health advice. We are exploring alternatives to the in-person programme of events'.
The White House has not yet released a statement on the contact Biden had with Martin and whether the president has been tested for coronavirus yet.
​​'In consultation with the Office of Attending Physician, the Speaker will continue regular testing and follow CDC guidance,' Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement. 'The Friends of Ireland Lunch today will proceed but without the participation of the Taoiseach.'
At the luncheon, Pelosi said of the events Thursday night: 'Right before I was supposed to give him the award the Taoiseach left the table.'
'So we're very very sad that the Taoiseach has the diagnosis,' she added.

President Joe Biden, 79, was also at the event, but the White House claims he did not come in 'close contact' with Martin
Martin left The Ireland Funds event early on Wednesday evening after his positive result was confirmed, according to UK-based news agency PA Media.
After Martin left, a person who attended the dinnertold CNNthat the Irish Ambassador to the U.S. Daniel Mulhall announced the results to the room.
After the PCR test results, Martin's press secretary released a statement saying the prime minister, known in Ireland as Taoiseach, had received a negative result earlier on Wednesday afternoon.
'The Taoiseach had also received a negative PCR test result on Sunday, taken before travel to the US,' the statement added. 'However, a further test was carried out when one of the Taoiseach's delegation received a positive test, which resulted in a later positive result for the Taoiseach.'
The Irish leader's positive diagnosis comes just two days after the White House announced that second gentleman Doug Emhoff tested positive for coronavirus.
Following the diagnosis, President Biden made a major gaffe Tuesday by saying he was the one that contracted COVID-19, when meaning to say Emhoff tested positive for the virus that day.
'The first lady's husband contacted COVID,' Biden said during an Equal Pay Day celebration for Women's history month.
Someone off to the side quickly corrected Biden, pointing out that his statement would mean he was the one with COVID.
'That's right,' he said to laughter from the room.
'She's fine. Second lady – the first gentleman, how about that?' he said with a smile as he continued his gaffe regarding the relations of who had coronavirus.
Biden did wear a mask at the event when walking to the podium for his remarks before removing it to speak
Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who is an active critic of Democrats on Twitter, posted a clip of the comment with: 'The First Lady's husband has no idea what he's saying….'
Emhoff, 57, tested positive after spending the afternoon with AmeriCorps at an environmental community service project in an urban garden in Northeast Washington, D.C.
'Earlier today, the Second Gentleman tested positive for COVID-19,' the White House released in a statement Tuesday evening.
The statement said that Vice President Kamala Harris tested negative for COVID-19 on Tuesday, but will continue to test now that her husband contracted the virus.
'Out of an abundance of caution, the Vice President will not participate in tonight's event,' it added, referencing the Women's History Month event at the White House.
Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff (left) tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, causing wife Vice President Kamala Harris (right) to skip out on a Women's History Month event at the White House 'out of an abundance of caution' despite testing negative
President Joe Biden made a major gaffe at the White House Tuesday by saying he was the ne who tested positive for coronavirus rather than Emhoff. 'The first lady's husband contacted COVID,' Biden said, before someone pointed out that statement would mean he was the one with the virus
The event still went on as planned Tuesday evening, but Biden made his major faux pas by accidentally claiming he was the one who got COVID.
Biden told the crowd to send 'our love' to Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president, since she could no longer attend the event celebrating women in the workforce and promoting equal pay between men and women as part of Women's History Month.
Emhoff's positive test came after former President Barack Obama announced on Sunday that he contracted coronavirus, but claimed wife Michelle was clear.
It also came after a group of seven House Democrats reported testing positive after attending a party retreat in Philadelphia over the weekend.
Biden attended and spoke at the event on Friday, but White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that he tested negative on Sunday.
Another pair of lawmakers who didn't go to the retreat also reported testing positive Friday and Monday.
The slew of positive results comes after the House finally lifted its mask mandate after two years of restrictions and lawmakers resumed the practice of gathering in close quarters in the chamber without masks.
COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed over the last month as case rates massively decline and hope emerges that the end of the pandemic is near

Among those reporting positive cases were senior members of the Democratic caucus, including powerful House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Representative Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut, 79 and impeachment managers Representatives Zoe Lofgren of California, 74, and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, 62.
Masks were optional at the retreat, which came during a time of lessening COVID restrictions.
Hours before news broke of Emhoff's positive test, the second gentleman was promoting the White House event celebrating Women's History Month.
'I took a step away from my career to support our first woman vice president, who happens to be my wife, Kamala Harris,' he told reporters during his trip to an urban garden in D.C. Tuesday afternoon.
'So it was something that was a no brainer to do, but I love practicing law. I loved every minute of it, but this is so rewarding,' he added.
'While I do miss what I was doing,' the country's first second gentleman said, 'if I was if I was going to step away from it, this is such an incredible honor to be able to do this and also, again, to support my wife.'
'It's important for men to step up and support women and not just say they're doing it, not just think they're doing it, but actually do it.'
'So I'm hoping to set a good example by what I've done,' he concluded in reference to giving up his career as a lawyer to move to Number One Observatory Circle with Harris.

John and Patrick Collison, speaking in Washington on Wednesday, were presented with the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) St Patrick's Day Science medal by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.
The award was also presented to Prof Donald McDonnell, associate director for translational research for the Duke Cancer Institute and Glaxo-Wellcome professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke University, School of Medicine in North Carolina, for his work in the development of new treatments for breast and prostate cancers
John Collison said they had ""massive optimism"" for tech, science and entrepreneurship in Ireland.
He said one of the areas about which they had spoken to the Taoiseach was education. He said they were really excited about the new immersive software programme at the University of Limerick which would see its first students in September.
Prof McDonnell said one of the themes in the talks with Mr Martin on Wednesday was how amazingly well Ireland had done in education and also in fundamental research.
He said Ireland was punching above its weight. He said some of the discoveries and some of the research centres in Ireland were “leading the way”.
He said the Conway Instutue in Dublin was one of the leading cancer bio marker institutes in the world.
He said he had left Ireland 35 years ago.
“If I was there now as a young PhD student, it would be very to leave because it is amazing what is going on,” he said.
Mr Martin said the awards were being made to the three in recognition of their “outstanding contributions to science and technology. We are deeply proud of their inspirational achievements and the societal and economic impacts they have made on the global stage. This prestigious prize recognises the critical importance of US-Ireland relations, particularly in the areas of research, development and innovation. Through these enduring transatlantic links, we are creating new opportunities and furthering knowledge with the potential to address societal needs and economic challenges, as well as nurturing future talent in the areas of science, technology, engineering and maths.”
John Collison said: “Patrick and I are honoured to accept this award. With all the talent and ambition in Ireland, we are convinced that many more young people will pursue a career in technology, and we can’t wait to see what problems they will solve.
“We will continue to do our bit, including through our partnership with the University of Limerick. The overwhelmingly positive response to the immersive software engineering course – and other projects like Fast Grants and the Arc Institute – have proved that we have a long runway ahead of us in terms of the investments we will continue to make in science, in technology and in Ireland’s potential.”

Martin Wall,Micheál Martin tests Covid-positive during St Patrick’s Day trip to Washington DC,Cancellation of Taoiseach’s traditional meeting with US president Joe Biden in Oval Office likely,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/miche%C3%A1l-martin-tests-covid-positive-during-st-patrick-s-day-trip-to-washington-dc-1.4829031?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-03-17T00:47:58+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has tested positive for Covid-19, leading to the cancellation of his St Patrick's Day face-to-face meeting with US president Joe Biden at the White House.
Plans for the Taoiseach’s St Patrick’s Day programme have been thrown into chaos by the news. The meeting between the Taoiseach and Mr Biden will now go ahead virtually in videoconference form, due to start at 2.30pm Irish time.
Mr Martin was attending the Ireland Funds dinner in the National Building Museum in Washington on Wednesday night, part of a programme of events in the US capital this week, when he received the news. Before the news about the Taoiseach's positive test, the event was addressed by Mr Biden, who received a rapturous reception from the 700 guests.
The dinner, held every year on the eve of the Taoiseach’s visit to the oval Office to meet the US president, is a major event in the Irish-American political calendar.
In his speech, Mr Biden praised Mr Martin and paid tribute to the links between Ireland and the US, drawing heavily on the experience of his own family.
The White House said Mr Biden’s speech ended at 7.54pm and he immediately left the podium. His motorcade left the venue four minutes later. He arrived at the venue at 7.10pm, officials said.
Irish ambassador Dan Mulhall told guests at the dinner that Mr Martin had tested positive in a precautionary PCR test earlier, after a member of the wider Irish delegation visiting Washington had tested positive on routine antigen test.
The White House insists that anyone visiting must undergo Covid-19 tests, with all visitors screened the day before they are scheduled to attend.
The first indication that something was amiss regarding the Taoiseach came as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi was finishing a speech. During her address, she welcomed the British ambassador to the event but warned her and the British government that if the border “hardened”, there would be no US-UK trade deal.
Ms Pelosi had been scheduled to make an award to Mr Martin.
Towards the end of her speech, she appeared to say that Mr Martin was on a call with European leaders. The Taoiseach had earlier been sitting next to Ms Pelosi.
Mr Mulhall then took the stage. He said Mr Martin had tested positive for Covid -19 but was feeling well.
Mr Martin, his officials who formed part of his delegation visiting Washington this week as well as travelling and resident journalists had to be tested.
Ahead of the St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House on Thursday, the Covid-19 testing was carried out on Wednesday afternoon and early evening.
The Taoiseach tested negative after undergoing an antigen test. However, one of his colleagues in the delegation tested positive, and he took a precautionary PCR test, which also proved positive.
Mr Martin then underwent a precautionary PCR test.
The White House indicated that Mr Biden was not considered a close contact.
However, the planned meeting with Mr Biden in the Oval Office on Thursday as well as the traditional shamrock ceremony will not take place, officials said. There were discussions between American and Irish officials about the potential of holding a virtual ceremony.
This week was to have been Mr Martin’s first and possibly final opportunity to travel to the White House as Taoiseach. Last year, the trip was cancelled due to Covid. Mr Martin is scheduled to rotate out of the role of Taoiseach next December.

“He represented people with an unwavering passion and commitment, always seeking to improve their lives. Dermot was a highly effective public representative whose passion for his constituents and work was evident every time he spoke to, or met with, colleagues.

IrishCentral Staff,"""Ireland - well, almost"" - Zelenskyy addresses Irish support of Ukraine","Taoiseach Micheál Martin does not believe Ireland was being ""singled out"" by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to the European Council on Thursday night.",https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/ireland-well-almost-zelenskyy-ukraine,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-03-25T16:11:52+00:00,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking via video feed from Kyiv, addressed the European Council on Thursday night and thanked each member state for standing with Ukraine during the conflict.
According to an official translation of his address, Zelenskyysaidin part: ""Italy - thank you for your support! Spain - we’ll find common ground. Belgium - we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I'm sure of it.
""Ireland - well, almost.""

Addressed the European Council and the nations of Europe, and stressed that Ukraine had not gone to a foreign land. Never dreamed of any war. Shoots down missiles. Urges strangers to lay down their arms and return home. For the sake of life. Ukraine has united for peace. And unites the world for the sake of peace.
Ireland moved earlyto waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugeesentering Ireland and has taken in more than 10,000 refugees since the beginning of the Russian invasion on February 24.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar recently told the Dáil that that figure may rise to 40,000 by the end of April.
Ireland was also the first western European country to join an informal grouping of eastern EU member states known as Friends of Ukraine, which is calling for Ukraine to be formally named an EU membership candidate.
However, Ireland did not send military aid to Ukraine during the conflict, choosing to opt-out of a €1 billion EU fund for military aid for Ukraine.
Instead, the Irish Government decided to send non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including€20 million in humanitarian assistance.
Speaking with reporters in Brussels on the second day of high-level European Commission meetings regarding the situation in Ukraine,Taoiseach Micheál Martin was asked if Ireland had been ""singled out"" by Zelenskyy.
""That wouldn’t have been my read of it,"" the Taoiseach said. ""He was actually talking in terms of the European perspective ... I wouldn’t have taken the same slant that some may be taking from it.""
He added: ""I spoke to him last week and he was very strongly in praise of the Irish contribution both from a humanitarian perspective and also in terms of our clear support for Ukraine’s application to join the European Union and he thanked me personally for my own personal commitment to that.
""So I’m not going to surmise in terms of whatever particular take you would take from the use of the word almost or practically and I wouldn’t overstate that to be frank.""
When asked if Zelenskyy's comments could be interpreted as meaning that he believed Ireland's support to be less intense than other countries, Martin said: ""I think that’s reading too much into it if I'm honest.""
""Obviously we're a military neutral country, but we explained that we facilitated the EU peace facility, which has been of enormous support to the Ukrainian people.
""So I wouldn't overstate it, quite frankly.""
Elsewhere in his address to the European Commission on Thursday night, Zelenskyy spoke of his standing desire for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union,which Ireland strongly supports.
""And now you and I are preparing Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Finally,"" Zelenskyy said.
""Here I ask you - do not be late. Please. Because during this month you have compared these worlds, and you see everything. You saw who is worth what. And you saw that Ukraine should be in the EU in the near future.
""At least you have everything for that. And we have this chance.""

Irish Voice Editorial,Irish Government rewriting the history of Michael Collins 100 years on,Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar are guilty of conjuring up a well-sanitized version of Michael Collins and his exploits during the recent commemorations of his death.,https://www.irishcentral.com/news/irishvoice/michael-collins-irish-rewriting-history,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-08-26T14:37:08+00:00,"Those who rewrite Irish history even around the edges play a dangerous game, especially when it comes to the Irish Civil War and Michael Collins.
Collins would hardly have recognized the encomiums offered by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tanaiste Leo Varadkar at the 100th anniversary of his death which was commemorated on August 21 before an estimated 10,000 people at the site where he was killed, the townland of Báal Na Mbláth, a few miles outside Cork City.
Whatever occurred on that lonely Cork road 100 years ago changed Ireland and Irish America forever. Without Collins, Ireland fell into the rigid Catholic conservatism happily overseen by Éamon de Valera, and partition was ignored until the very people themselves rose up in 1969.
Martin and Varadkar, the two current leaders of the Irish government, are guilty of conjuring up a well-sanitized version of Collins and his exploits in their speeches which did not rise to the occasion, the first joint commemoration by the two parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, created by the Irish Civil War, a mighty event in itself.
Such an occasion called for truth-telling, not bogus biographies of the man who did more to free Ireland than any other person in modern history.
Essentially they both agreed that Collins was anti-violence in outlook, treading on the path to peace, and would practically be a non-participant in future violence but for seeking to end the Irish Civil War which was his mission in Cork on that fateful day he was killed.

The truth, as revealed again in some recentlong-lost diaries, was that Collins was far from conciliatory in his private notes, referring to the fact that he had won the treaty debate and the people were with him and those facing him were “Irregulars,” a term used to describe an illegitimate army.
Collins as a man of peace hardly holds up. He had formed “The Squad,” a secret assassination group dedicated to ridding Ireland of British spies. 14 such spies from the notorious British Cairo gang were killed on November 21, 1920, leading tothe Bloody Sunday massacreby British forces at Croke Park in Dublin.
Man of peace? Hardly. A man of war dedicated to ridding Ireland of the British by whatever means, including raw violence, is a far better nomenclature for Collins it seems.
We don’t know the type of Ireland Collins would have built. He could have become a military dictator which was becoming quite a fashion with Franco and Mussolini in Spain and Italy respectively, or perhaps a political dictator like Lenin.
At just 31, Collins had a very long political career ahead and was likely to have outlived most of his contemporaries. No doubt the conflict with de Valera would also have continued but a strong voice for a more open, liberal Ireland such as what Collins might well have provided would have changed everything.
We can definitely surmise that he would never have accepted the Boundary Commission's findings that Northern Ireland and its six counties would stay in place.
Historian Tim Pat Coogan has given numerous examples of where Collins made it clear the border would not stand. Collins would surely have insisted on two more counties, Tyrone and Down, be given to the Free State given the fact they had Catholic majorities.
We will never know, of course, how it all would have turned out. As Collins retreats further and further into history we are left with speculation, not facts.
One hundred years on, the “Big Fellow” remains elusive.

THE PENSION AGE should not go beyond 66, Taoiseach Micheál Martin told his parliamentary party meeting today.
He said additional PRSI contributions will be needed to ensure the pension age is not increased.
“People should also be allowed to work on if they wish and continue to pay PRSI so they can qualify for a full pension. Flexibility will be key,” he said.
Martin said a “fair and sustainable approach” will be required to give people certainty.
His comments seem to temper expectations that a rise in the pension age could be on the cards.
Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys said last month that she will be bringing the much-delayed proposals on the pension age to Government before the summer recess. However, the Taoiseach’s comments today indicate this will now not be the case.
The recommendation has been delayed going to Government, with the minister previously stating that she would bring proposals in April.

The Pension Commission report published last October said that the State pension age should rise by three months each year from 2028 until it hits 67 in 2031.
The report also recommended that it should then gradually increase to 68 by 2039.
However, the Oireachtas Social Protection Committee recommended that the State pension should be retained at its current age of 66 and that changes to employers’ PRSI contribution rates should be examined by the Commission on Welfare and Taxation to determine the fairest way to increase the rates.
Taoiseach says there was a good discussion on pensions at the parliamentary party meeting on the budget.‘I made the point that we didn't see the age going beyond 66,’ says Micheál Martin.pic.twitter.com/iwT4d5OqZn— Christina Finn (@christinafinn8)July 1, 2022

Speaking to reporters after the Fianna Fáil party meeting in Dublin, the Taoiseach said retaining the pension age at 66 would have implications on PRSI increases “in the medium term”.
“But above all, we have to work with coalition parties on finalising that more,” he added.
The Government will consider both the commission’s and the committee’s recommendations “in the round”, said Martin.
“These are weighty issues,” he added, indicating that the recommendation will now not go to Cabinet before the summer recess, as was previously indicated by Minister Humphreys.
“We don’t have a specific timeline just yet,” he said, adding that the Tax and Welfare Commission is in November.
Related ReadsProposals on possible pension age increase to go to Govt before summer recess, says ministerThe government's launched a plan to auto-enrol workers for pensions - here's how it will work
“We have to throw that into the overall assessment,” he said.
Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath said the coalition parties have yet to reach a collective position on the matter.
He said the Pension Commission “was very clear that doing nothing is not an option, because there are real sustainability issues with the pension system and we all know the demographic trends in Ireland”.
“The ratio is changing very significantly of the number of people that work relative to the number of people who will be on the pension. But it did lay out four broad options,” he said, outlining that one relates to changes over time with PRSI rates that would allow the retention of the existing pension age.
There would also be flexibility for people who reach the age of 66 and have a small number of stamps, that they would be able to work that little bit longer and continue to pay a stamp, which would be recognised, and would result in them being compensated to the full pension a little bit later.
“So there are those flexibilities as well. But the bottom line is we have to adopt an approach that is sustainable, but we are recognising that there are options in that regard.
“One of those options is and it was clearly the preferred approach advocated by our own parliamentary party today, that the pension age would remain unchanged.
The pension age became a major, andrather unexpected, political issuein the last general election afterFianna Fáil promisedto postpone the rise to 67. Fine Gael insisted on it going ahead, while Sinn Féin pledged to restore the pension age to 65.

Darragh Ó Sé,Darragh Ó Sé: The worst thing about Sunday’s melee is politicians making hay out of it,"Nobody is defending Tiernan Kelly but spare me the likes of Micheál Martin, Charlie Flanagan and Catherine Martin scoring political points out of it all",https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2022/06/29/darragh-o-se-column-armagh-v-galway-melee-brawl-politicians-michael-martin-headlines-pushing-shoving-gaa-gardai/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-06-29T05:04:01+00:00,"On Monday morning, my phone beeped with a message from the Pat Kenny radio show. That’s never good. If the Pat Kenny show are ringing up a hobo like me, it probably isn’t because they want to discuss the finer points of midfield play. “So you see, Pat, a lot of teams run set-plays off the throw-in now because it’s the one time the opposition can’t get enough men back ...”
Lo and behold, that wasn’t what they were after. They wanted to know would I like to come on at nine o’clock to talk about the violence in Croke Park on Sunday. And straight away, that told me where we were. We were in one of those situations that comes up every so often. The outside world sees a bit of mileage in a GAA story and they all pile in. You’d think there was nothing else going on in the world.
Nobody in the GAA wants to make out that all-in rows are a good thing. Nobody thinks that. And there’s absolutely nobody defending the eye-gouge on Damien Comer. It was an outrageous act and the CCCC will obviously deal with it severely. There will be punishments handed down and so there should be.
[As it Happened: All-Ireland quarter-finals - Galway (after penalty shootout) and Kerry reach final fourOpens in new window]
But GAA people aren’t fools either. They know when something is serious and they also know when people from other walks of life are using the association for their own betterment. Especially when politicians decide to rise themselves up to their full height and start throwing down judgments. It would be nearly comical if it wasn’t so obvious.
Take Charlie Flanagan for example. Now, Charlie has been around a long while. He is experienced in public life, he knows how everything goes and how everything works. And there he was on Sunday night, going on Twitter and calling for the cops to get involved. “Gardai should investigate violent confrontation in Croke Park. Expect some in @rte & @officialgaa to reduce it to ‘handbags’.”
Now remember, this man used to be the Minister for Justice. This isn’t some nobody spouting off on Twitter and throwing around loose words that mean nothing and have no consequences. God help us — this is somebody that people might think they should take seriously. And what’s he doing with his time? He’s declaring that the Gardaí need to be devoting their time to a spell of pulling and dragging at a sporting event.
[Gardaí confirm they are not investigating Galway vs Armagh brawlOpens in new window]
Come on now. We are all grown-ups here. We all know the difference between the hold-me-back stuff we saw on Sunday and actual violence. Again, nobody is saying it’s great stuff, nobody is saying it’s a lovely thing to look at, nobody is suggesting that the GAA shouldn’t punish anyone who has broken the rules.
But getting the Gardaí involved? That’s off-the-wall stuff for anyone to be suggesting, never mind someone who not so long ago was in charge of the force. You can just imagine some young Garda in Fitzgibbon Street on Monday morning being told he has to start ringing around to find out about a row on the pitch down the street the day before. “Ah jaysus ...”
And if that wasn’t bad enough, Catherine Martin had to get involved later in the day on Monday. She was asked about it at some press event and couldn’t help but get in there and grab a piece of the action for herself.
[Kevin McStay: GAA must stop facilitating the easy acceptance of foul playOpens in new window]
“The eye-gouging incident is appalling stuff,” she said. “Families go to these games. I know of a five-year-old who was at that yesterday, their first match experience. They should have come home talking about what an amazing experience it was.”
I know she’s the Minister for Sport. I know she was only asked a question and gave an answer. But if we know one thing about politicians, it’s that they are highly-skilled at deflecting when it suits them. She could have let it slide by and said it looked bad but it was a matter for the GAA and they should be left to deal with it themselves. But instead she started going on about families with kids and worrying about what they saw.
I was there on Sunday with my eight-year-old and my 13-year-old. All they saw was a mad, exciting game of football, one they got totally engrossed in while they were waiting on their own county to come out and play Mayo. The eight-year-old kept turning to me and asking, “Who are we shouting for here, Daddy?” I was trying to explain that I was neutral in all this because I wasn’t overly sure yet who I didn’t want to meet down the line (if we get that far).

There is no way any child who was in that stadium on Sunday went away scarred by a row. If you think that, it’s a while since you’ve brought a child to a sporting event. Kids who go to matches care about their team, the result and what sweets they’re getting — and it’s very rarely in that order.
I don’t for one second think that an intelligent woman like Catherine Martin believes any different. That’s the worst thing about all this. The politicians who weigh in on these things do it so that they can get noticed and pick up votes. But it’s all silly beggars and they know well it is.
The Taoiseach got in on the act too. Michéal Martin wasn’t going to let it slip by without having his say: “it was a shocking scene. It was a great game of football and awful that it was marred by what transpired at the end of the game.” He did at least say that the GAA will deal with it through their own procedures but he still had to finish up by calling it “quite disturbing and quite upsetting”.
Was it? Were people really disturbed? Were they even upset? I don’t think that really stacks up. Because when it comes right down to it, what did it amount to? If you actually sit down and watch it and be cold and unemotional about it, what do you see?
Unless there’s a camera angle that I haven’t come across yet, it adds up to one extremely bad act by Tiernan Kelly and an awful lot of pushing and shoving outside of that. Plus Kieran Donaghy in a very loud top that he would have been well within his rights to get a clipping for.
You could see it coming. There were subplots going on all around the field as the game came towards the crescendo at the end. It was building up from the moment Ethan Rafferty took the head off Damien Comer coming for an early ball. Comer put that away in the hard drive and kept it for later.
So when Shane Walsh scored a point soon after the first Galway goal, Comer went in and remembered he owed Rafferty that few bob from earlier and let him know all about it. Rafferty body-slammed Comer for his troubles and Comer actually got a yellow card.
But Comer went way up in my estimation — and I liked him a lot already. He was wise to what the temperature of the game was. Armagh put a lot of store in mouthing and sledging — you could see James Morgan at it the whole time with Walsh and Ciarán Mackin, the sub who came on with the glasses, never shut up yapping at Robert Finnerty. Comer basically said: ‘Well if ye want to go down that road lads, I’m here all day.’
So when the two teams went off towards the Cusack Stand at full-time, it was no surprise that Morgan had plenty to say for himself and that Comer was primed and ready to give it all back to him. And next thing you know, a bit of mouthing leads to a bit of pushing and since everybody’s already running in the one direction anyway, you get what we got.
[‘Penalties are for soccer, not for GAA’ - shootout and ugly brawl dominate after Galway winOpens in new window]
But what did we get, really and truly? I have been in the middle of those things. Every player has. Sometimes I’ve seen them get out of control and I’ve seen people get hurt. But there is a massive difference between those kinds of rows and what we saw on Sunday.
I know people will say, “Yeah but the eye-gouge is a disgrace.” And it is. But ask yourself this — if there was no eye-gouge, would there be no outrage? Or would politicians and everybody else still be lining up to have their cut at the melee anyway? I get the feeling they would. They’re having their own free-for-all here and I think the eye-gouge is giving them a nice bit of cover to do it.
Tiernan Kelly did a stupid, terrible thing. He was lucky the consequences weren’t worse for Damien Comer. Nobody is arguing anything else. But the reality of the situation now is that there’s a river of shit flowing down the mountain on to this lad from people who know absolutely nothing about him or the sport or anything to do with the situation at the time. And there is no hiding place on this little island.
I hope we don’t get to a place where the CCCC feels it has to weigh in with loads of suspensions now just because this stuff caused a few politicians to do the Holy Mary Mother Of God routine
You’d think politicians would know that better than anyone. You’d think they’d have a bit more understanding of something that happens in the heat of the moment while tensions are running high. Who are they to comment on someone’s life like that? It shows an awful lack of imagination on their part to be getting stuck in for the sake of making a headline. It doesn’t say much for them that they have so little to be concerning themselves with.
For the GAA and for those of us who were there and who were watching on television, it’s an awful pity that this stuff is being allowed to take away from what was 100 minutes of pure entertainment. The Kerry v Mayo game after it couldn’t hold a candle to it. It was one of the best games I’ve been at for a few years and both teams deserve huge credit.
The transgressions should be dealt with. The punishments should be handed down. The row should be assessed in detail and with a fair eye. I hope we don’t get to a place where the CCCC feels it has to weigh in with loads of suspensions now just because this stuff caused a few politicians to do the Holy Mary Mother Of God routine. Whatever decision they make should be fair and rational.
It would be nice if everyone could just grow up and cop on a bit.

AN TAOISEACH MICHEÁL Martin has said that the DUP’s refusal to participate in forming an executive in the North was “unacceptable”.
Martin said that the DUP’s refusal to take part in the assembly was damaging the functioning of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and this was to the detriment of people in the North.
“It is to the detriment of the people of Northern Ireland that their Executive is not in place to take the decisions and provide the leadership that the North needs, particularly as we face into a difficult and economically challenging winter,” Martin said.
“It is a denial of the mandate they gave in the elections of the fifth of May.
An Taoiseach was speaking  earlier today at the British Irish Association Conference at Pembroke College in Oxford. He said had been “completely consistent on this issue” and had expressed similar views when Sinn Fein withdrew from the Executive in 2017.
Martin said that when the Executive broke down on previous occasions, both governments worked hard to resolve the issues, “make progress and restore the Institutions”.
Assembly elections were held on 5 May of this year following the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive. The DUP withdrew in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Sinn Féin secured 27 seats and the DUP won 25, but the DUP said it would not nominate a deputy first minister until “decisive action” is taken on the protocol, which has led to a deadlock.
Speaking at the same conference yesterday evening, in comments carried byRTÉ News, the UK government’s Northern Ireland Secretary of State Shailesh Vara said if parties in the North didn’t form an Executive, he would call another assembly election by the end of October.

Northern Ireland Protocol
The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed upon by the EU and the UK during Brexit negotiations. It governs the trading relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and is aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland.
There have been some implementation difficulties with the protocol, and it has become a serious bone of contention between the EU and the UK, with the British government bringing forward legislation to unilaterally suspend key aspects of the protocol. Ireland and the EU have said that this would break international law and renege on key aspects of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
Speaking yesterday, Vara said that the British government’s plans to set aside part of the protocol was an “insurance policy”.
“Our aim with the legislation on the Northern Ireland Protocol is to put in place an insurance policy so that we can ensure we have a way of resolving the issues with the Protocol,” he said.
However, today Martin said the moves by the UK to suspend aspects of the protocol risked causing further instability in the North, and will fray the relationship with Ireland.
“I am deeply concerned about the British Government’s legislation which would unilaterally undo core elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” said Martin.
The Taoiseach said he was concerned by what such moves could mean for a partnership between the UK and the EU and for the message it would send about rules-based international order. But, most of all, Martin said he was “concerned because it is neither in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland nor what they want”.
He said the EU recognised “that there have been genuine difficulties with aspects of the implementation of the Protocol”.
Martin was speaking ahead of the announcement of a new Prime Minister on Monday, when either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will become the new leader of the Conservative Party.
“I wish them well in the challenging times ahead,” he said.

,"A chance ‘to return to the true spirit of partnership’, Taoiseach says as Boris Johnson resigns",‘The relationship between our governments has been strained and challenged in recent times’ Micheál Martin says,https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/07/07/a-chance-to-return-to-the-true-spirit-of-partnership-taoiseach-says-as-boris-johnson-resigns/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-07-07T12:35:23+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the departure of Boris Johnson from Downing Street will present an opportunity to reset and improve British-Irish relations.
Mr Martin acknowledged that Mr Johnson had “been through a difficult couple of months” and said he wished “him and his family all the best for the future”.
He said it was fair to say that the British-Irish relationship had come “under strain” but that “opportunities now arise to reset that relationship”.
Mr Martin said a change in prime minister was an opportunity to improve the relationship but that was “on the basis of adhering to established agreements that have been entered into freely ... particularly in relation to the [Northern Ireland] protocol”.
He said he wanted to get back to “the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which really was about the two governments working hand in hand”.
On the emerging contest within the Conservative Party, Mr Martin said that within the party “there are elements which never had the same commitment to the DNA of the Good Friday Agreement as the broader parliamentary majority in Westminster would have”.
“There are many Conservatives, on the other hand, who were dismayed by the unilateralism, particularly at the decision to bring in legislation to unilaterally override the agreement that the Westminster parliament has ratified,” Mr Martin added.
[Dublin breathes sigh of relief as Johnson bows outOpens in new window]
The Taoiseach said Mr Johnson had led the British government “during an especially challenging period, including dealing with the impact of Covid-19 and the response to the war on Ukraine”.
“From a personal perspective I am conscious that he has been through a difficult few weeks and I extend my best wishes to him and his family for the future, following the announcement of his resignation.”
Mr Martin said the relationships between the two countries are “long, deep and enduring”.
[UK PM Boris Johnson resigns saying ‘no one is remotely indispensable’Opens in new window]
“I think there’s an opportunity for people to go back to the fundamentals of how politics is done, how international relations are conducted, how agreements entered into are adhered to and that we use the mechanisms in those agreements to resolve any issues.”
He warned that the existing British government proposals would be damaging to industry and business in Northern Ireland — which he said was the view of the business community in the North, not something coming from politicians.
Asked if he had anything good to say about Mr Johnson, the Taoiseach said he had not said anything bad about him on a personal level. “On a personal level we got on well. But we didn’t agree on fundamental issues,” he said.
“On a personal front, he was good company,” Mr Martin added. “That’s generally the experience of most people.”
Mr Martin declined to be drawn on potential candidates for the Conservative leadership, but said he hoped a new prime minister would return to “how business is normally conducted in respect of international agreements”.
Speaking on a visit to the United Nations in New York, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also expressed the hope that there will be a rethink on the part of the next administration in London on plans to unilaterally disapply key parts of the Northern Ireland protocol.
“We hope this can be an opportunity for a new beginning in terms of an appetite for honest and sincere dialogue in terms of the partnership that is needed to resolve questions that are outstanding.”
He maintained that if the British side pressed ahead under a new government with the plans proposed by Boris Johnson’s cabinet for unilateral action on the Northern Ireland protocol it would “really damage” Britain’s relations with the European Union.
“I think for any new prime minister coming in to deliberately undermine and damage trust with the EU as one of first policy and legislative initiatives would be an extraordinary decision when actually the EU wants to compromise and wants to improve relations between UK and EU,” Mr Coveney said.
He said he hoped the approach of the next British government would change “in that they have not been willing to be part of serious negotiations with the EU since February 11th and have pressed ahead instead with unilateral legislation which breaches international law over the last few weeks”.
Mr Coveney said he hoped there would be a return to partnership and a negotiated approach where both sides could work together to find a middle-ground position and provide the stability that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland wanted.
“I said ever since this [British] legislation was published that it would cause an awful lot more problems than it solved. That is the view of every European capital as well the European institutions and the administration in Washington.
“All Britain’s friends are telling them this is not the way to solve problems, to break international law unilaterally, to essentially set aside international agreements that are extremely important to your neighbours. That is not the way to solve this problem.”
Mr Coveney is scheduled to travel to London on Monday for engagements that were scheduled prior to Mr Johnson’s resignation.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Mr Johnson had been “witty and engaging” but unfortunately the Irish and British people would for years to come have to live with the negative consequences of Mr Johnson’s advocacy for Brexit.
Mr Varadkar said he disagreed with Mr Johnson on many things “but I always found him a personable, witty, engaging and intelligent man”.
The Tánaiste said Mr Johnson had been an “excellent and innovative” mayor of London. But he added: “Regrettably he chose the wrong side in the great debate on Europe before he became prime minister and we and the British people will be living with the negative consequences for many years to come.”
“It could have been different. I hope that he will put his boundless energy and enthusiasm to good use in the future”.
Mary Lou McDonald, meanwhile, said Mr Johnson’s interactions with Ireland had been wholly negative and “he will not be missed”. She said under his leadership there had been an attack on the Belfast Agreement and “threat after threat to break international law”.
“Mr Johnson’s government brought austerity to people in the North of Ireland and of course, he championed and brought Brexit to all of us, so, I think it needs to be stated very clearly that whoever succeeds Boris Johnson now as prime minister needs to change direction and change tack and we need a British government that respects international law,” she said.
“We need the Assembly and the Executive established without further delay in the North,” she added.
The party’s vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, tweeted: “It has been an utter absurdity that the people here have been subjected to Boris Johnson for any length of time.
“Anyone who tries to sabotage our peace agreements, a quarter century of progress and our shared future is truly no friend of ours.”
Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the DUP, indicated that the change of prime minister would not change his party’s position on the protocol.
“It is no secret that we believed that Boris Johnson had a duty to get rid of the Irish Sea border, having disastrously gone against our advice and signed a withdrawal agreement containing the protocol,” he said.
“Fully-functioning devolved government in Stormont and the protocol cannot coexist.”
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Boris Johnson had “debased” the office he held.
“He has fundamentally and indelibly damaged public confidence in politics and public life and his death grip on power has prolonged a period of government that will be characterised by lawbreaking, scandal and sleaze,” he said.

ALL EYES WILL be on what portfolio Micheál Martin will opt for when he takes over as Tánaiste in December.
Many Fianna Fáilers at the party think-in this week believe if Martin opts for foreign affairs, it will be an indication that he plans to vacate the position as party leader sooner rather than later.
Given the inflation crisis and the focus on the impending budget, there was no talk of leadership challenges over the two days in Westmeath but it is expected at some point before December. By then, some members will be asking, quite forcefully, what Martin’s intentions are as leader.
A number of TDs and senators, some loyal cheerleaders and some not in the Martin camp, were certain that the Mullingar think-in would be his last as party leader.
Despite Martin stating that he plans to stay on as leader of Fianna Fáil and lead the party into the next election, some TDs and senators have said that it can’t be allowed to happen “for the party’s sake”.
As part of the government formation plans, when he rotates out of the position of Taoiseach and into the role of Tánaiste, he will also receive a ministry.
While some wish for him to just take Leo Varadkar’s post as Minister for Enterprise and Trade – allowing for a seamless switch – others have said he might choose to take on Education or Higher Education, given his strong interest in both portfolios.
Some speculated that the call of the Department of Foreign Affairs – one he served in before and speaks very fondly of – will be too tempting for him to turn down.
“If he chooses foreign affairs, that will be a clear indication that he plans to head off as party leader and perhaps take up a job in Europe,” surmised one TD this week.
Another said he might have “no choice” but to take on the ministry after Simon Coveney, stating that it would mean Fianna Fáil would have input into matters in Northern Ireland, along with the Department of An Taoiseach.

The job would require him to be out of the country a lot, which would give backbenchers ample opportunity to formulate a heave against the leader and get a successor primed and ready.
The break away Fianna Fáilers, some who have already spoken out publicly about their concerns and who held a private meeting away from ministers and the party leader in July are understood to “keeping the head down” until after the budget.
It is likely another meeting could take place in October, after the party’s Ard Fheis which is taking place in the RDS the weekend after the budget.
It is believed that some were unhappy with the structured nature of the party think-in, instead wanting more time to discuss the direction of the party.
The Taoiseach rejected internal party criticism over his failure to facilitate the backbench meeting.
Speaking to reporters, Martin said the public is not interested in “excessive navel-gazing” by political parties, saying that the people want the Government to get on with sorting out the country.
Hurling legend Brian Cody was a guest speaker at the party think-in this week.
It’s understood that he told politicians they should free themselves of egos, something the Taoiseach was keen to mention in passing. Others were equally keen to mention that Cody managed the Kilkenny county team between 1998 and 2022, retiring only this year.
Perhaps Martin wanted advice on how to stay on in a job for so long, joked some party members.
But Martin rejected any assertions there was a Fianna Fáil identity problem that needed to be discussed.
“I don’t accept that. I don’t accept it as an identity issue, I think there’s an over fixation by certain people on that,” he said.
Some Fianna Fáiler’s scoffed at the remark, stating that the “head-in-the-sand” attitude is going to run the party into the ground unless something changes soon.

,New sanctions placed on Russia by US and UK as Ukraine warns residents to flee embattled west,Taoiseach Micheál Martin called for the “toughest sanctions” to be placed on Russia by the EU.,https://www.thejournal.ie/new-sanctions-ukraine-invasion-5732175-Apr2022/,thejournal,general,en,ie,2022-04-06T19:48:17+00:00,"We need your help now

THE US AND the UK announced new sanctions against Russia today after Ukraine said hundreds of civilians were found dead around its capital, as Kyiv warned residents in the east of the country to get out ”now” ahead of a feared assault.
It come as Ireland has said it will push for the “strongest” sanctions against Russia to be implemented by the EU.
Earlier today, the White House unveiled measures targeting Russia’s top public and private banks and two daughters of President Vladimir Putin, while Britain sanctioned two banks — and vowed to eliminate all Russian oil and gas imports by year-end.
Their actions followed an international outcry after Ukraine said its forces found hundreds of civilians dead around the capital Kyiv, including the town of Bucha, after Russian troops withdrew.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin was among EU leaders calling for further tough sanctions against Russia following the killing of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha.
Speaking to his parliamentary party this evening, Martin said that Ireland “would continue to push for the strongest sanctions on Russia at an EU level”.
It is understood that he told the meeting that over 20,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Ireland since the war broke out in late February.
He added that there were now over 2,000 Ukrainian children registered with primary schools, while 1,800 have entered into secondary school.
Martin said that there would also be additional capacity built into the health and education systems, as well as further accommodation provided to refugees.
Russianwithdrawals
As further sanctions are considered by the EU, the Russian withdrawal from areas around Kyiv and the north is part of a shift in focus towards Ukraine’s southeast, in a bid to create a land bridge between occupied Crimea and Moscow-backed separatist statelets in the region of Donbas.
Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk today warned residents in the eastern Kharkiv, Lugansk and Donetsk regions to leave immediately due a feared Russian attack.
“It has to be done now because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death,” she wrote on Telegram.
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said there was no sign Putin had dropped “his ambition to control the whole of Ukraine”.
“We have to be realistic and realise that this may last for a long time, for many months, for even years,” he said ahead of a meeting with NATO foreign ministers.
Zelenskyy called for Russia’s exclusion from the UN Security Council, where it is one of five members with veto power, and made an impassioned plea for action in response to the civilian killings.
“They cut off limbs… slashed their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children,” he said, after earlier comparing Russia’s assault to the 1937 Nazi bombing of the town of Guernica.
The US and Britain have also pressed to have Russia excluded from the UN Human Rights Council, with a vote in the General Assembly scheduled for tomorrow.
At his weekly audience at the Vatican, Pope Francis deplored the “powerlessness of international organisations” before what he called “ever more horrendous cruelties”, before kissing a flag brought from Bucha.
Thousands of people have been killed and more than 11 million displaced as refugees or within Ukraine since Russia invaded, sparking Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.
Western powers have already pummelled Russia with debilitating economic sanctions, which forced Moscow to make foreign debt payments on dollar-denominated bonds in rubles, raising the prospect of a potential default.
Washington’s new sanctions targeted Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova, two adult daughters of Putin, plus the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and members of the Russia’s Security Council.

The White House also declared “full blocking” sanctions on Russia’s largest public and private financial institutions, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, and said all new US investment in Russia was now prohibited.
Britain meanwhile froze the overseas assets of Sberbank — Russia’s largest bank — and Credit Bank of Moscow.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier said what happened in Bucha “doesn’t look far short of genocide to me”.
EU ‘indecisiveness’
The EU is also poised to implement a fifth round of sanctions cutting off Russian coal imports — and European Council chief Charles Michel said that “sooner or later”, it must also impose oil and gas sanctions.
Condemning “war crimes” in Russia, he said: “There must be, and there will be, severe consequences for all those responsible.”
But addressing the Oireachtas today, Zelenskyy condemned the “indecisiveness” on the part of European nations dependent on Russian energy.
He called for the total exclusion of Russian banks from Western finance.
In other moves to isolate Moscow, EU countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain have expelled more than 200 Russian diplomats and staff between them this week.
The Kremlin called the mass expulsions a “short-sighted move” that would complicate efforts to negotiate an end to the hostilities.
Peace talks between the sides have so far gone nowhere, though Moscow says it is “ready” to continue.
Putin also warned of “reprisals” for recent European measures targeting Russian gas giant Gazprom — and said Moscow would “monitor” its food exports to “hostile” nations, raising the spectre of shortages and price spikes.
Satellite photos taken while Bucha was still under Moscow’s control show what appear to be bodies lying in streets where the dead were later found by Ukrainian forces and seen by journalists.
Multiple Bucha residents told AFP they had seen Russian soldiers killing civilians.
“Right in front of my eyes, they fired on a man who was going to get food at the supermarket,” said 43-year-old Olena, who declined to give her family name.
During a grim cleanup, the remains of partially burned bodies in black bags were lifted into a van, with officials telling journalists “dozens of bodies” remained in apartments and in nearby woods.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who will visit Kyiv this week, has offered the bloc’s assistance in documenting proof of war crimes.
Scenes of devastation have met those venturing into other areas from which Russian forces have withdrawn.
In the northern city of Chernigiv, which was besieged from the early days of the invasion, a charred children’s hospital, full of bullet and shrapnel holes, served as a shelter.
“Cluster bombs were flying, we have traces of these bombs,” said 51-year-old Olena Makoviy. “The injured were brought to the children’s hospital, both adults and children.”
City officials estimate around 350 civilians have been killed in Chernigiv, with fellow residents digging mass graves to bury them.
“It was very scary here from the first days of the war,” said Makoviy. “They brought guys, handsome, young, but no longer alive.”

,"Dispute between council and local radio station a concern, says Taoiseach","An effort by Wexford County Council to ensure presenters of a local radio station would not express personal opinions on air in return for the council taking out advertising has been described as “very hard to comprehend” by the Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

On Saturday The Irish Times reported that in an email on March 25th, the Wexford county secretary, David Minogue, requested that no personal opinions be expressed by broadcasters on South East Radio as part of a proposed agreement on a €40,000-€50,000 spend this year by the council on advertising.
He also asked the station to keep raw, unedited recordings for a period of two years in case any dispute should arise between the council and the station.
The controversy came weeks after the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) issued a report in which it criticised the chief executive of Wexford County Council, Tom Enright, for putting ""unwarranted"" pressure on South East Radio during a 2019 row about coverage of the council by the station.
The criticism centred on the threat that council advertising would be withdrawn from the station.
Asked about the weekend report, the Taoiseach said that “if that is the case, it would be very difficult to comprehend”.
“One doesn’t need a Sipo report to know that in any executive authority, you do not attempt to intimidate the media or attempt to shape media’s output, or commentary, on the basis that you will withdraw advertising from them, if that is what transpired.
“We are in a free society with a free media and media are entitled to secure advertising in a free market like everybody else. There can be no connection between advertising sponsorship and editorial control. And so I would be very concerned with this.”
In a response to Mr Minogue on April 1st, the managing director of South East Radio, Eamonn Buttle, said its presenters ""will not be censored in the manner that you seek for the benefit of [Wexford Council Council].""
“In a democratic society, such behaviour cannot and must not be tolerated. South East Radio certainly will not stand for it.”
At a council meeting on Monday, Mr Minogue read out the content of his email to Mr Buttle, and described Mr Buttle’s responding email as “pretty remarkable”.
Mr Minogue told The Irish Times that since the weekend he had made a complaint to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland against South East Radio, because of Mr Buttle’s response to his email and other matters, but now intends to withdraw the complaint.
“I don’t consider that such a complaint would be helpful in the context of building relations [with South East Radio] and for that reason I am withdrawing it. Not for any other.”
The council chairwoman, Barbara Anne Murphy, of Fianna Fáil, said she believes in the freedom of the press and did not believe the council taking advertising should be linked to the station's editorial content.
“I really feel that we need to get back and rebuild our relationship with South East Radio and that’s what we have to do,” she said in an interview on Tuesday with South East Radio’s Morning Mix show.

THE WORLD’S POLITICAL and business elite will hobnob in Davos next week after a two-year break caused by Covid, with the Ukraine war set to dominate the exclusive Swiss mountain summit.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar will be among the attendees at the World Economic Forum, with Martin participating in a high-profile discussion on Wednesday about “European Unity in a Disordered World?”.
Martin will be joined in the discussion by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger, ECB President Christine Lagarde and President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola.
The world has changed drastically since the last time the World Economic Forum took place in person at the ski resort in January 2020.
At the time, US President Donald Trump and climate campaigner Greta Thunberg headlined the show and the coronavirus had yet to spread widely outside China.
Since then, the outbreak in China turned into a pandemic that rocked the global economy, Trump lost the US election to Joe Biden, countries have endured climate change-driven weather disasters, inflation has surged and Russia invaded Ukraine.
After a virtual forum in 2021 and the postponement of this year’s in-person event due to the Omicron variant, the WEF returns to its Davos den on Monday under the theme “History at a Turning Point”.
But the hub of cheerleaders of capitalism and globalisation will lack its usual scenic snowy backdrop — and the usual Russian contingent.
President Vladimir Putin spoke at the online meeting last year, but organisers decided to exclude Russians this time as Western powers have imposed sanctions on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict.
Instead, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the summit via video link while around a dozen officials from his country will attend in person.
WEF founder Klaus Schwab said it would be “the most timely and consequential” meeting since the creation of the forum more than 50 years ago.
“Russia’s aggression on the country will be seen in future history books as the breakdown of the post-World War II and post-Cold War order,” Schwab said in a pre-summit briefing, adding that Davos will do what it can to support Ukraine and its recovery.
WEF president Borge Brende, who will moderate Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s discussion, said that excluding the Russians from the forum was “the right decision”.

“We do hope, though, that Russia will follow a different path … in the years to come to start to stick to the UN charter and to their international obligations,” Brende said.
Few stars
More than 50 heads of state or government will be among the 2,500 delegates ranging from business leaders to academics and civil society figures attending the four-day gathering.
Some of the biggest names include Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, NATO head Jens Stoltenberg and US climate envoy John Kerry.
While war will overshadow the meeting, the forum will also have panels on everything from climate change to rising energy prices, global supply chain problems, gender inequality, poverty, football and the metaverse.
This year’s meeting, though, lacks some of the star power of the past. Some, such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, spoke in a virtual version in January.
Festival of wealth
The forum has produced some consequential moments.
It hosted the first ministerial meetings between North and South Korea in 1989 as well as talks between South Africa’s apartheid-era president F. W. de Klerk and then dissident Nelson Mandela in 1992.
The forum, however, regularly faces criticism as evidence of the cozy relationship between the political and corporate elite.
“At this Davos, at this festival of wealth, I think we’re going to see just how profoundly unequal our world has become,” said Nabil Ahmed, head of strategy at global charity Oxfam.
But Oxfam, which is pushing for taxes on the rich, is also among Davos regulars.
“I think it’s important to go to Davos to challenge power, to put forward hard facts, to talk directly to these governments and corporations and amplify the voices they’re not listening to,” Ahmed said.

In Northern Ireland, recently elected MLAs, reflecting the intensity of politics in a small place, are digging themselves deeper into the rutted terrain of blame, counter blame and limited concession on ideological preferences. Arguing themselves into institutionalised confrontation.
Reports from London and Brussels paint a picture of former ‘partners’ drifting further apart.
Simon Coveney, TD is talking selectively of an erosion of peace arising from any UK unilateral departure from a treaty.  There are no reported comments this time based on old newspapers from the 1970s or the unfettered trade denied to Northern Ireland but enjoyed by Ireland; and wasn’t it an Irish leader who acted unilaterally from 1932 onwards to ignore a Treaty which did not meet his republican agenda, only to trigger an ‘economic war’?
Apparently, Ireland is not that same ‘place’ anymore or is it that with the rise of Sinn Féin and an election due, it is important to face down the ‘Brit’ with patronising assurances of EU flexibility; thus far notable only in their insignificance and lack of any meaningful focus on what is not working?
“You can have your medicines at our pleasure”is not calculated to calm the gathering storm.Neglectful of its own deep-seated societal turbulence, the less than impartial Irish-fetishist American caucus has weighed in predictably.
If theIreland/NI Protocol, to use the official title, too often ignored by politicians and lazy media commentators, were indeed an airplane in search of a landing zone, it is beingbuffeted mercilessly in the prevailing turbulence of non-diplomacy. Those on board seem oblivious to the fact that if it comes crashing to the ground there will be numerous casualties andwe won’t need a black box to know why.
Good sense points to acknowledging that it should have been provided with a more navigable flight plan.
Have negotiations, isolated from the very obvious impact of flawed thinking, manoeuvred the Ireland/NI Protocol(IRISH PROTOCOL would be a better shorthand) to a point where it will be no longer possible to regain sufficient lift; to pull away from the gravity of standoffs and a refusal to acknowledge that it is simply not fit for purpose?
There is an alternative.
Leaders would do well to ponder the words of former MP and leader of the SDLP, MLA, Deputy First Minister and Minister for Finance and Personnel,Mark Durkan Senior.  It should become required reading:
We did not reach the Good Friday Agreement by ignoring what each other was saying or simply dismissing problems or prospects that others were raising.
Currently on track for another period of political and rhetorical tug of war which, as I have suggested before, is highly uncomfortable when you are the rope, the recent suggestion ofLord Frostthat the Belfast Agreement is on ‘life support’presents as valid.
You cannot protect the Agreement if you are not in accord with it and this goes beyond unfettered trade.
Those currently mandated to govern, understandably frustrated at the course of events, seemunable to resist echo-chamber thinking and dismissive, bordering on reckless, rhetoricthatleaves limited space for consensus and squeezes the life out of meaningful discourse.
All the local parties are affected as are London, Brussels, Dublin and Washington. A blame game underpinned by indulgent monologues lacking in any constructive reflection are leveraged as a long-suffering community is abandoned to the role of spectator with political relationships falling foul of a lack of rational, evidenced-based and clearly communicated analysis.
There has to be a better way; building consensus as opposed to rigidity on the application of the Ireland/NI Protocol.
The first, albeit imbued with too much fudge and constructive ambiguity, delivered a process-based agreement in 1998; the latter has brought it to the brink of extinction too often. It required thinking which saw possibilities in the intransigence of political opposition and openness to adjustment to achieve a working accommodation; a cessation of politically motivated violence to build peace.
Today, attitudes which fuelled violence are no longer characterised by the weaponry of the past but have emerged as hard-wired doctrinaire resistance to movement from the fixed point.
Added to the mix is the piecemeal annexation and administrative integration of the Northern Ireland economy facilitated by the Protocol which is bringing out the worst in those who delivered it; not least a protectionist and interventionist EU. None seem to grasp fully the reality of the problems they continue to create.
The need to re-visit and re-imagine is an imperative.
The politics of the Ireland/NI Protocol are too invested with constitutional and ideological baggage, camouflaged as disputed assertions as to its benefits and drawbacks, all of which are not fully known. With future decision-making on VAT, directives and standards within the EU to be determined, divergence cannot be assessed, only anticipated. The long-term impact on state subsidies is also for the future. All of this is grounded on the shaky premise of lack of representation from Northern Ireland.
Currently positioned in an extended grace period, it is not fully in place and therefore judgement as to its consequences remains problematic, speculative and ill-advised.
The size of the NI Economy whilst it is hoped it will grow further carries very limited risk to the EU Single Market. Yet, 20% of checks in the EU as a whole take place in regard to NI which accounts for 0.2% of trade. This is not sustainable or ethical, merely punitive.
Two years into a grace period, has any serious damage been caused to the Single Market? Most of the goods that arrive in Northern Ireland from GB are for internal consumption.
We have bureaucracy for bureaucracy’s sake.
There is positive spin on an all-island economy but is it merely trade diversion with difficulties in supply chains causing businesses to seek alternative sources.
Former Irish Diplomat,Rory Montgomeryacknowledges this and how, following Brexit, the Irish Government was concerned the withdrawal of the United Kingdom could impact on the Common Travel Area requiring Ireland to join the Schengen area. In the event, this did not materialise.
Ireland a special case?
He further comments, that the Ireland/NI Protocol is a product of Ireland’s negotiating success.
In the light of events, it is legitimate to ask why similar energy was not put into achieving the same flexibility for Northern Ireland as available to Ireland. Was Northern Ireland ‘a special case’ forfeit to a protectionist and limiting Withdrawal Agreement and fear of contagion or Ireland, having got what it needed, simply closing rank with its partners; with the three strands and the principle of consent of the Good Friday Agreement thrown out of kilter and off course by an emphasis on over-regulated decision-making and failure to address the political context in which any Ireland/ Northern Ireland Protocol would be sited.
This is a major contrast in how, in dealing with Ukraine, the EU has shown what ‘unfettered flexibility’ looks like. This has not gone unnoticed in Northern Ireland.
Westminster is not without responsibility.
Article 50 was triggered without clarity as to what kind of deal was targeted. Against the background of competing agendas in parliament, the UK was railroaded into accepting a Withdrawal Agreement wherein, having already re-affirmed the CTA, it took responsibility for policing the Single Market within its own borders and all of this prior to discussing trade.
It much too readily accepted that the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement somehow implied an’ invisible border’ on the island of Ireland and bowed to the nationalist mantra of ‘Britain’s moral culpability’ for Brexit.
Pragmatic solutions and political implications were rendered less important than ideology and‘getting Brexit done.’
Standards are determined by what consumers are prepared to accept. That’s how markets operate. The Single Market would have been protected by distributors, consumer choice and lack of demand for goods which do meet required standards. Goods which are not marketable are unlikely to find their way into shops or businesses.
Is there then a need to treat every item as being ‘at risk’when the vast bulk of goods coming into Northern Ireland will stay where they arrive.
The use of red and green routes or trusted traders could solve some of the emerging cost and supply issues.
If there are trust issues, could Dublin step up to the mark?
Items deemed at risk can be monitored within the Good Friday structures; protecting them rather than undermining them.
This was raised early in the discourse following Brexit.
Writing last year in Fortnight magazine, Mark Durkan, senior, comments on the possibilities and contends convincingly that the
‘under -used bandwidth of Strand Two could be used to answer some of the challenges stemming from Brexit.’
He further writes that that North South Ministerial Council could be entrusted to consider the implementation of EU policies, presumably in line with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.
With almost two hundred All-Island Bodies and provision for a British-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, is there not potential for also putting in place practices to address the democratic deficit that arises from Northern Ireland’s having to adhere to EU decisions. without representation.
It would require greater buy-in from political unionism than at present.
Would discussions on these lines alongside suggestions from Lord Empey of the UUP and his party’s suggestions for the unfettered entry of goods facilitate a re-framing of the decisions pertaining to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol around problem-solving, collaboration, consensus and functional modelling of scenarios, likely to arise.
The UK and EU have agreed to a model without testing out a prototype.
Such a process, of necessity, could involve the electorate beyond listening to over-heated discussion in television studios.
There have been too many comments from the public that reveal limited understanding of the implications for cost of living, the survival of businesses, disruption to supply chains and relationships.
The public needs facts beyond opinions and conjecture with the Protocol still disapplied.
Professor Katy Haywardhas written of the value of civic engagement in enhancing democratic quality and legitimacy; as yet largely untapped in Northern Ireland.
There must be value in bringing together focus groups or civic assemblies to re-define the present impasse in terms of issue-centred evidence-gathering, targeting stability, economic opportunities, participative democracy and settling politics down to a place where the NI Assembly, with all its shortcomings, can operate.
Participants would be charged with starting from a central position of building consensus and seeking to limit movement to the extremes where our politics seem to start.
By 2024, the NI Assembly will be asked to vote on continuing Articles within the Ireland/ NI Protocol.
There is time for evidence-based modelling of the implications of the Protocol,provided grace periods can be extended and improvements for implementation made operational as they emerge; to run in parallel with the operation of the Assembly.
A focus on determining an alternative Protocol orthodoxy and how positives can be maximised to ensure that a more stable and prosperous Northern Ireland becomes the lived experience; with the balance in the inter-relationship of the Belfast Agreement restored, can diminish if not remove current constitutional polemics.
The potential for restoring the currently fraught relationships on the island of Ireland in the interests of reconciliation and normalisation, ought to be self-evident.

Mr Martin delivered the graveside oration at the funeral of Mr O'Kennedy who died aged 86 on Friday in Dublin.
Mr O'Kennedy served as an Oireachtas member for more than 35 years, holding six different ministerial portfolios. He was also a European commissioner.
Mr Martin said his former colleague was known internationally and met with many of world leaders of the late 20th century.
""Yet wherever he was in the world and whatever high position he held, Michael O'Kennedy was always defined by the values he learned here in Nenagh. ""
He was destined from an early age to make his mark after an outstanding career as a student in UCD and after studying for the bar, the Taoiseach recalled.
He was championed in his early career by then taoiseach Seán Lemass who saw in Mr O’Kennedy a “deep intelligence with an understanding that a democratic republic should both be proud of its history and constantly looking for ways to improve”.
He was also involved in the Northern Ireland negotiations, the Taoiseach recalled. ""He never failed to speak up for basic democratic republican principles. And he never faltered in his belief that dialogue built on democratic principles was the only sustainable route forward.""
He was held in high regard not only in Fianna Fáil but in other parties too as witnessed by tributes from President Michael D Higgins and former Fine Gael taoiseach John Bruton, among others. ""
“The tributes are testament to both his decency and the fact that his was no ordinary career,” said Mr Martin.
Mr O’Kennedy’s son Brian told the funeral Mass at St Mary of the Rosary Church in Nenagh that his father was “always a Nenagh boy at heart” wherever he went in the world.
His proudest moment was when he brought 20 agriculture ministers across Europe to visit his mother and her little shop in Nenagh.
“He treated all people in the same way without fear or prejudice,” he said.
Brian O’Kennedy thanked respective Fianna Fáil taoisigh for giving his father the opportunity to serve his country.
“He was a proud Fianna Fáil man. He was proud of the progressive and mature republic we are so fortunate to live in.”
Delivering the homily at the funeral Mass, former bishop of Killaloe Willie Walsh said Mr O'Kennedy had a ""very strong faith"" which he demonstrated in his love for his wife of 56 years, Breda, and their three children.
He said the “vast majority” of public representatives serve out of a “sense of idealism and generosity”. They do so, he added, often at the expense of privacy in their lives and at the expense of time with their families and friends.

JIM O’SULLIVAN,
Rathedmond,
Sligo.
Sir, – Taoiseach Micheál Martin has rejected the idea of putting a cap on the number of Ukrainian refugees in Ireland (News, April 25th). Is this realistic? We all have total compassion for these people and it is almost impossible to comprehend the devastation in their lives. However, we have a housing crisis in this country which is nowhere near being solved. How can we find accommodation for the thousands of refugees who are here already and the further thousands now expected? Already people who offered shelter in the first flood of desire to help have withdrawn their offers. Others accepted refugees into their homes and found themselves unable to cope. This is not a commitment for a few weeks and the situation could last for years. Even if hostilities ceased tomorrow, how long would it take for Ukrainians to be in a position to return to their country, much of which has been destroyed? Is there a proper plan in progress for accepting and dealing with all the problems and the heartbreak of those now suffering?
Altruism is admirable but we have to be sure that we can carry out what we promise. – Yours, etc,

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said Russia is using “very sinister” tactics after state television showed a mock-up of both Ireland and the UK being destroyed by a nuclear strike.
The simulated clip, which appeared on Russian state broadcaster Russia-1 over the weekend, shows a nuclear sub launching a missile to hit the coast off Ireland, creating a tsunami which would destroy both Ireland and the UK.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Martin said that the clip represented a worrying mindset, which was not in touch with reality.
“It’s very sinister intimidatory type tactics by the Russian Federation, but I don’t think anyone’s going to be intimidated by it,” said Martin.
“I think it reflects a mindset that is worrying and not in touch with reality.”

He called for an apology to be made by the Russian state broadcaster for playing the clip.

The simulated clips were played on Russia-1, with TV host Dmitry Kiselyov appearing alongside the clip, speaking about destroying the UK with nuclear weapons.
In the clip, Kiselyov says that an underwater drone could be deployed to “plunge the British Isles into the depths of the sea”.
The clip shows a nuclear warhead being detonated off the northwest coast of Ireland, with Kiselyov saying that a 500 metre tall tsunami would engulf both Ireland and the UK.
“The warhead has a yield of up to 100 megatons and will cause a gigantic tidal wave up to 500m high,” Kiselyov says.
“Such a barrage alone also carries extreme doses of radiation”.
He adds that the strike would turn the British Isles into a “radioactive desert, unfit for anything for a long time”.
Kiselyov is one of the most powerful figures within Russian media and is well known within the country for his close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Minister for Public Expenditure, Michael McGrath, said that it was “disturbing” to see both Ireland and the UK “wiped out” in a simulation.
When asked if Russia’s ambassador to Ireland, Yuri Filatov, should be brought to the Department of Foreign Affairs to explain the clip, McGrath said that it was for the Department to decided the “most appropriate diplomatic response”.

Addressing an event commemorating the 1845-52 famine, which resulted in more than two million people either dying or emigrating, Micheál Martin said famine was an irregular but significant part of Irish and European history.
“However, the 19th century was supposed to be the age of new technology in transport, communications and agriculture. Widespread famines were supposed to be a thing of the past – here we were to witness the most devastating and widespread death through starvation and illness ever recorded,” he said in his speech at the National Famine Museum in Strokestown, Co Roscommon on Sunday.
“The rising nationalist and then republican politics which followed in the decades, which ultimately led to independence, was absolutely shaped by the famine and public understanding of what had been allowed to happen.”
Mr Martin cited the Nobel Prize-winning economists Amartya Sen, who studied famines and concluded that they do not happen in democracies.
“I think if you want to know why Ireland never again had a famine, you will find it in our commitment to self-determination and building a democratic state. Our refusal to follow the extreme ideologies of the 20th century was driven by this commitment. As we mark 100 years of this State, that is a powerful lesson for us to remember.”
The Taoiseach said one of the reasons why the people of Ukraine “prize their freedom so dearly is that they too bear deep scars from a famine which destroyed millions of lives”.
“The Holodomor of 1932-33 was a crime against humanity – a famine imposed on what is one of the largest food-producing countries in the world,” he said.
“When the people of Ukraine voted for independence, they did so in a spirit of self-reliance and without rancour. They chose for themselves a simple flag of a clear sky over fields of wheat. It was not an aggressive and exclusionary nationalism, but a nationalism which we and so many others can relate to.”
Minister of State Jack Chambers told the event, which took place in Strokestown for the first time since 2014, that final preparations were being made to reopen the museum later this month after a €5 million redevelopment.
He described the famine “as the darkest period in our history” and said it was “important we remember the victims”.
Following a wreath-laying ceremony, a minute’s silence was observed in memory of the victims of the famine, following which the Last Post was performed, the tricolour was raised and Amhrán na bhFiann was performed.

LAST UPDATE|19 Nov 2022
THE TAOISEACH HAS confirmed that there will be an inquiry into allegations of abuse by members of the Spiritans order, in Blackrock College and elsewhere.
Micheál Martin said today that the government will engage with victims to determine what the inquiry will look like.
Speaking to reporters today, Martin said: “We have to identify the best way forward in a victim-led way.
“I think inevitably, that means some form of inquiry would have to be established here. We’d have to take on board the views of victims, and also identify the most effective way to conduct an inquiry.”
It emerged last week that 233 people had made allegations of abuse against 77 Irish Spiritans in ministries throughout Ireland and abroad. Of those, 57 people alleged they were abused on the Blackrock College campus.
Further allegations of sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders have emerged in recent days, including in Castleknock College in Dublin, which is run by the Vincentian Community.
In astatement toThe Journal, the religious order said that over the last 15 years, it has received allegations of abuse from former students of Castleknock College, St. Patrick’s College in Armagh, St Paul’s in Raheny and St Peter’s National School in Phibsborough.

When asked whether an inquiry would be limited to Blackrock College and the Spiritans, Martin said: “These are the issues we’re going we will have to examine.
“A module-based approach might be the most effective and timely,” he said. “I’m very anxious that whatever we do, we have the best interests of victims in mind.”
The Spiritan Congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers, has given a public apology to victims, and announced that an independent group would engage with survivors of abuse at schools and institutions decades ago.
Former Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said today that some of the abusers “should never have been teachers.”
Speaking on RTÉ Radio One, he said the number of allegations from Blackrock College were “frightening”.
“The numbers were frightening because they were all in the one institution and a very prestigious institution, and here were perpetrators who eat with one another, who lived with one another, who knew one another.
“I don’t know at any particular moment how many horrendous abusers lived together at any one time in that community. It’s hard to fathom.
“Some of these men were extraordinarily violent men … Some of these people should never have been teachers and certainly they should never have been allowed to be teachers in a boarding school.
“On reflection, boarding school is obviously a place where you need double protection.”

LAST UPDATE|26 Oct 2022
THERE HAVE BEEN calls for joint authority of Northern Ireland by both the Irish and UK Governments if the Executive and Assembly is unable to be restored, with Taoiseach Micheál Martin saying that there cannot be a return to “direct rule of the past”.
Both Sinn Féin and the SDLP have said that there cannot be a return to direct rule of Northern Ireland by the UK Government alone and that there needed to be a joint arrangement including the Irish Government.
It comes as it appears no Northern Ireland Executive will be formed by this Friday’s deadline, with fresh elections nowlikely to be called by NI Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.
SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, said that there needed to be clarity for the public in Northern Ireland as the Executive continues to be blocked.
“Given the uncertainty around the future of our political institutions and speculation around a way forward in the absence of an Assembly and Executive, I think we need to have clarity for people here around the next steps if the DUP continue their boycott,” Eastwood said.
“The prospect of a disintegrating Tory party running Northern Ireland from Westminster would rightly concern people here. They have shown they are totally unfit to govern and any attempt to assert more control here in the form of direct rule would be undemocratic and could not command broad support.”

He said that restoring the Northern Ireland institutions would be the best way of dealing with issues, particularly on the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and healthcare matters.
Sinn Féin deputy leader and First Minister designate Michelle O’Neill said that the Irish government needed to “insert itself” into the joint partnership approach.
O’Neill told RTÉ Radio One: “I think that this will be a time for the Irish government to very much insert itself in terms of the joint partnership approach.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said hisparty is “ready to fight” in an election after a meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at Westminster.
Donaldson told reporters there was “still some way to go” in solving the problems over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
He said: “I think the Secretary of State is of a mind to call an election, that is a matter for the Government, frankly I don’t think it helps us to get any quicker towards the solution that we need or to get the political institutions back up and running and fully functioning again.
“We need to clear away the debris of the protocol, that needs to be our focus, we need to get agreement on arrangements that respect Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom and that allow for continuing cross-border trade where that is required, and I don’t see how an election helps us to get there.
“But, to be clear, we’re ready to fight in that election, I’ve just been signing off on our election literature, we’re ready to go. If the Secretary of State decides to call the election I’m not afraid to take my case to the people.”

During Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil this afternoon, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that the DUP cannot continue to block the formation of the Executive as part of efforts to restore direct rule.
“Political unionism has to understand that wrecking the institutions of government will not usher in direct rule from London,” said McDonald.

“If the restoration of the executive in Belfast is blocked indefinitely by the DUP, the only alternative will be an arrangement of joint authority between the Irish state and the British state.
“This is in line with the position taken in 2006 by the Irish and British governments when facing into a deadlock situation.”
McDonald called on Taoiseach Micheál Martin to engage with new UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and ensure that “direct rule from London is off the table”.
In response, Martin agreed that there “cannot be a return to the direct rule arrangements of the past” and that the Irish Government would work under a “consultative role” agreed under the Good Friday Agreement.

URSULA VON DER Leyen is set to address the Dáil and the Seanad next month on a visit to Dublin.
The European Commission President will meet with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and President Michael D Higgins during a trip to Ireland on 1 December, according to a Commission spokesperson.
She will deliver an address to the Houses of the Oireachtas, becoming the 23rd leader to address a joint sitting of the two houses.
Yesterday, von der Leyen, who has held her role as Commission President since 2019, announced that the EU is working on another round of sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine.

“We will not rest until Ukraine has prevailed over Putin and his unlawful and barbaric war,” she said.
Earlier this year, a virtual address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy filled the chamber in Leinster House for a joint sitting to hear the Ukrainian leader.
Speaking to TDs, senators and guests, Zelenskyy said that Russia should no longer be accepted as a civilised nation due to its bombing of hospitals, churches and shelters in Ukraine.
“It should be held responsible for everything they have done on Ukrainian soil,” he said.
“They have come to Ukraine as a colonising army, their state propagandists and their politicians are not even concealing what they want.
“In the 21st century, they’re looking at their country as a colonial empire who allegedly has the right to subdue a neighboring people and destroy the foundations of their independent life, their identity.”

He was speaking as the Dáil debated a motion from Sinn Féin last night calling for the planned rises this year to be deferred.
Micheál Martin has warned fuel costs are likely to increase again as a result of sanctions against Russia and Germany halting a planned gas pipeline.
The Taoiseach was asked if that means they’ll consider deferring carbon tax increases:

There were sharp exchanges between Mr Martin and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald in the Dáil on Wednesday.
Speaking during Leaders' Questions, Ms McDonald raised a story which appeared in the Irish Sun that the O'Devaney Gardens site developer Bartra warned it would sell 500 homes to a cuckoo fund if the Government did not buy them all for a set price believed to be close to €400,000 per apartment.
A €400 million redevelopment of O'Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7 is made up of 10 apartment blocks with 1,047 units. The project, given the green light by An Bord Pleanála last year, is about 40 per cent larger than the original schemes backed by Dublin City Council in 2019 and is significantly different to the low-rise project initially envisioned.
Ms McDonald said the developer was “effectively trying to blackmail the taxpayer and is using the powerful presence of cuckoo funds as leverage”. She said this wasn’t their “first act of bad faith” with delays in building the homes and challenging planning decisions, and that the developer was now holding the Government “to ransom”.
“The fiasco at O’Devaney Gardens is a mess of the Government’s own making. Government was warned at the time and again that this was a terrible deal for tenants, for homeowners and for the taxpayer,” Ms McDonald said.
“You were warned that sidelining the local authority and gifting public land to private developers was a really bad idea.”
Ms McDonald said if ever there was ""a salutary tale and lesson of Fianna Fáil in Government – the party of the Galway tent, brown envelopes and a cosy relationship with developers,"" it was O'Devaney Gardens.
In response, Mr Martin said Sinn Féin was “rewriting the narrative again today” because “unfortunately for you the housing issue has been all about politics”.
“O’Devaney Gardens would have been built a long time ago if it wasn’t for people playing politics with it. It’s either the Sinn Féin way or the highway,” he said.
Mr Martin noted that Ms McDonald had talked about the “corrupted nature” of the Government’s relationship with developers, adding that Sinn Féin was “the last party to talk to anybody about corruption”.
“Your party corrupted public life in this Republic for well on 40 years, to a far greater degree than any other party in this country. You corrupted the moral code of our country and our society by the murder and mayhem that you perpetrated and that you still endorse. You still endorse it, you still support the narrative of murder and mayhem and so forth,” he said.
“You also support the undermining of women that were raped by IRA volunteers and your party covered it up. Do not come into this House, lead with your chin, telling this party that we were corrupt. We had faults and flaws, no doubt about it, but we faced up to it . . . you consistently try and rewrite the narrative, bury the truth about the level of corruption that your party engaged in.”
Ms McDonald repeatedly shouted across the chamber that Mr Martin was “pathetic”.

Mr Martin told the Cork Chamber 2022 Annual Dinner the government is committed to investing €165 billion in regionally balanced growth before 2030 under the National Development Plan and Cork will be among the principal beneficiaries.
The plan involves the development of strong cities that will act as drivers of growth for their wider region, and the future of Cork and its surrounding region is central to achieving that ambition, he said.
Cork Airport will have a role to play in that growth, not just as a regional airport but as an airport with the potential to provide much wider connectivity internationally which will help attract more foreign direct investment, he said.
""Other projects are being funded with secured investment, including the Cork City Flood Relief Scheme, investments at the Port, the Events Centre and the development of a heritage quarter in Mitchelstown.
""I believe passionately that we have to invest in all of our communities so that none are left behind. That's why we have announced urban regeneration plans, which provide over €400 million for transformative projects in the Docklands, the Grand Parade Quarter, in Mallow Town Centre, and in the Passage West - Ringaskiddy – Carrigaline Harbour Cluster.""
Mr Martin said growing communities need a more accessible, reliable, and faster public transport system and the spine of such a system was now being put in place on Leeside with BusConnects Cork which is creating 12 new transport corridors.
He said that every major advance in Ireland in the past 60 years rested on a foundation of opening access to education and the recent creation of the Munster Technological University was further evidence of the Government's commitment to investing in education.
""The Munster Technological University will complement the prodigious reputations of both UCC and the Tyndall National Institute, driving the economic development of not just Cork but the broader south-west,"" he said.
Mr Martin instanced the success of Global Shares in Clonakilty as an example of how innovators, educational institutions, researchers and government can lead to success with the company, founded nearly 20 years ago, now has nearly $200 billion under management.
And he pointed to Cork's success in being chosen by the European Commission for inclusion in the highly competitive, Climate- Neutral Smart Cities Mission whereby Cork will be supported in accelerating green and digital innovation.
Meanwhile, the Port of Cork is well positioned to benefit from the opportunities arising from developing offshore renewables sources of energy and as a consequence can become a national and international leader in the off-shore energy sector.
Turning to Ireland’s response to the Covid pandemic, Mr Martin said the pandemic was “the most profound public health emergency in over a century” which required the full mobilisation of the resources of the state.
“We have many lessons to learn from our pandemic response, but the evidence is overwhelming that Ireland came through the worst of the pandemic as one of the best in the world in terms of controlling its impact and utilising the vaccines.”
Mr Martin said that Ireland was able to deal with the pandemic through a strong community spirit, a responsive state and strong international partnerships with people rallying around to look out for the most vulnerable while the public service proved its effectiveness.
“Key challenges were responded to rapidly in order to limit the health and economic impact of the pandemic. In total, over €20 billion was provided to support businesses and workers. These interventions saved many businesses, livelihoods, and jobs.
“And I want to acknowledge the incredible work of so many companies and business leaders in finding new ways to keep as much employment as possible and to find innovative ways through the pandemic recession,” he said.

Shawn Pogatchnik,Irish PM: Sinn Féin’s big Belfast win hasn’t advanced unity,Micheál Martin says his Irish republican rivals advanced in Northern Ireland by downplaying the issue of unification.,https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-prime-minister-micheal-martin-fianna-fail-sinn-fein-northern-ireland-assembly-election-2022-unification/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,europeanvoice,general,en,us,2022-05-09T12:46:38+00:00,"Micheál Martin says his Irish republican rivals advanced in Northern Ireland by downplaying the issue of unification.
BELFAST — Sinn Féin’sbig winin the Northern Ireland Assembly election hasn’t advanced the goal of uniting the two parts of Ireland, Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin argued Monday.
Martin — whose Fianna Fáil party will face an uphill battle against Sinn Féin whenever the Republic of Ireland next goes to the polls — said his opponents had barely mentioned the goal of Irish unification when campaigning north of the border.
For more polling data from across Europe visitPOLITICOPoll of Polls.
“We all support a united Ireland. Our party’s objective is a united Ireland. But it was striking, and this has to be said, that was not the mandate sought by Sinn Féin in the last few weeks,” Martintold RTÉ radioin Dublin.
Martin suggested that Sinn Féin had soft-pedaled the topic in favor of “bread and butter” issues because those broaden the party’s appeal, while calls for pushing Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland do not.
Polls consistently show most Northern Irish voters, including a minority of Irish nationalists, don’t want to leave the United Kingdom primarily for economic reasons, though such views have beenundermined by Brexit.
“The whole [Sinn Féin] campaign was on cost of living, health, housing,” Martin said. “The border was buried in its documentation and its manifesto. And as soon as the votes are counted, it’s brought back to center stage.”
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald didtalk up prospectsfor an Ireland-wide referendum following her party’s record performance in Northern Ireland, where the party won 29 percent of votes and overtook the Democratic Unionists for the first time.
And Sinn Féin’s20-page manifestodoes include a page on promoting unification. As the only Irish party contesting elections on both sides of the border, it is the only one trying to lead coalition governments in both Belfast and, perhaps soon, Dublin.
It won the most votes in the Irish Republic’s2020 general election, mirroring its Belfast breakthrough. But the centrist old guard of southern politics, Martin’s Fianna Fáil and Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael, agreed to form an unprecedented pact that kept Sinn Féin stuck in opposition. As part of their coalition agreement, Martin will swap jobs with Varadkar in December as their coalition seeks to survive to early 2025, by which time the next election must happen.
The latestopinion poll, published Sunday, shows Martin remains the most popular political leader in the Republic of Ireland – but only fractionally ahead of McDonald. The poll rated Sinn Féin’s popularity south of the border at 34 percent, approaching the combined total of Fianna Fáil (16 percent) and Fine Gael (23 percent).

The Taoiseach made the comments to a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on Wednesday. He was responding to the publication on Wednesday morning of a HSE review into allegations that young people who attended mental health services in south Kerry were prescribed inappropriate medication.
The report said that hundreds of children received “risky” treatment from a doctor working in mental health in south Kerry and significant harm was caused to 46 of them.
“It has caused significant harm to a number of young people in the area [in question]. There are fundamental issues here and what has happened is not good enough,” Mr Martin told the meeting of his parliamentarians.
He told the meeting that young people had been failed by the Camhs service there.
Mr Martin also told the meeting that the number of people employed in the State is running ahead of all projections.
Mr Martin told his parliamentary party on Wednesday evening that the economy was recovering at what he described as a “great pace”, giving an upbeat assessment of prospects following the lifting of Covid restrictions.
However, he did say that there were potential obstacles and challenges.
“We recognise the challenges with energy prices and the cost of living. The Government has taken targeted measures in social protection and engagement with social partners will also be important over the coming months,” Mr Martin is said to have told the party’s TDs and Senators.
Much of the meeting was taken up by a discussion on housing. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien gave a briefing on progress in the Housing for All strategy.
“The pipeline of housing supply is very good,” claimed Mr Martin on the back of the briefing, pointing to an increase in the number of apprenticeships in construction.
Several TDs and Senators raised the question of affordability for younger people who wished to own their own home, including Lisa Chambers and James O'Connor.
Mr O'Connor argued for the Central Bank to ease its rules for housing to allow younger people access to needed credit. He told the meeting that young homebuyers found themselves caught in a clinch, as paying huge sums in rent each month impacted badly on their ability to raise deposits to buy homes.
Minister for Education Norma Foley updated the meeting on the process involved in deciding what form this year's Leaving Certificate will take.
Irish Water was also criticised during the meeting for what one parliamentary party member described as the “extortionate” charges for connecting premises.

LAST UPDATE|27 Jan 2022
MICHAEL D HIGGINS, Taoiseach Micheal Martin and former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn will feature in a programme of events to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
A series of events will take place over the weekend in Derry to mark the anniversary of the date when 13 civil rights protesters were shot dead by British soldiers on January 30 1972, in the city.
Another man shot by paratroopers on the day died four months later.
While many consider him the 14th victim of Bloody Sunday, his death was formally attributed to an inoperable brain tumour.
President Higgins will deliver a recorded message to the Bloody Sunday families on Sunday.
The president’s message will be shown publicly during the commemorative event Beyond the Silence, which will take place before a limited audience in Guildhall Square.
His message will be broadcast on a large screen and the occasion will be livestreamed to an online audience.
The event will be hosted by actor Adrian Dunbar and will feature tributes to the victims, as well as music and public performances.
Guildhall Square will fall then silent on Sunday at the precise time when 50 years earlier paratroopers opened fire on civil rights marchers in the Bogside.
Earlier on Sunday, relatives of those who were shot and injured will take part in a walk of remembrance which will set out from Creggan Shops and make its way to the Bloody Sunday Monument in Rossville Street for the annual memorial service and wreath-laying ceremony at 11am.

Micheál Martin will lay a wreath and is also expected to meet privately with the families of those killed.
Bloody Sunday Trust chairperson Tony Doherty said: “This Sunday is January 30.
“It will be exactly 50 years to the day and the date since Bloody Sunday.
“The families will be gathering at the Creggan shops at 9:15am and we are going to walk to the Bloody Sunday monument for 11am.
“We would like all the people of the city and beyond to join us, regardless of your political persuasion, regardless of your beliefs, religious, political or otherwise and stand in solidarity with us on Sunday morning.”
The 2022 Bloody Sunday Memorial Lecture will be delivered at Derry’s Guildhall on Saturday by Mr Corbyn, a long time supporter of the Bloody Sunday families.
The MP for Islington North in London will give his lecture at the same location where most of the hearings in the Bloody Sunday Inquiry took place.
The inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, replaced the verdict of the Widgery Tribunal which had largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame.
Lord Saville’s inquiry found that none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify their shooting.
It said no warning was given to any civilians before the soldiers opened fire and that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks by petrol bombers or stone throwers.
Saville found there was “some firing by republican paramilitaries” but that on balance the Army fired first.
Former prime minister David Cameron told the House of Commons in 2010 that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has told the Dáil that three Irish-based companies linked to Russian individuals or banks who’ve been sanctioned by the EU have so far been identified.
Martin was speaking in response to a question from Catherine Murphy TD of the Social Democrats who asked the Taoiseach what Ireland was doing to “close any loopholes and ensure there is no place for dirty money to hide in this country”.
“We know that tens of billions of Russian money has been funnelled through Ireland using financial services operations in the IFSC and entities called limited partnerships,” Murphy said.

“One of the attractions of limited partnerships is that there is no requirement to publicly disclose by whom they are really owned.”
In response, Martin said:
“The Central Bank of Ireland has undertaken an initial review of the links between the approximately 3,000 Irish domiciled special purpose entities and any links between them and Russian entities. Some 34 of these 3,000 entities have a Russian sponsor, meaning that they were established on behalf of a Russian company.
The EU has introduced several rounds of sanctions against Russia as a reaction to the recognition of separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and then Russia’s subsequent invasion.
The23 February sanctions referredto by the Taoiseach are sanctions against the 351 members of the Russian State Duma which voted for recognition and an additional 27 individuals.

An Taoiseach also said the in terms of investment funds the Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held at 31 December 2021 are estimated at €11.4 billion or 0.3% of the total Irish fund assets of €3.8 trillion.

""The evidence is growing that the protocol is having a beneficial impact on the Northern Ireland economy,"" Mr Martin told reporters yesterday. Officials in Dublin say that they have received a large amount of representations in support of the protocol from Northern business interests.
“I think there is a need now for pragmatism and commonsense,” Mr Martin added.
He said it is “unsatisfactory” and disappointing that the DUP had decided to block the election of an Assembly speaker yesterday.
“The people elected an Assembly, the Assembly should meet, and then the Assembly should form an executive,” Mr Martin said. “Yes, there are issues that unionism has raised with us in respect of the protocol, but those issues should not prevent the establishment and convening of the Assembly and the formation of the executive.”
Mr Martin said that the European Union had been ""very flexible"" in relation to the protocol, and has offered solutions on issues like medicines being exported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Mr Martin was speaking to reporters in Co Kildare at the unveiling of 29 homes in Sallins, Co Kildare. Officials said last night that the Taoiseach would visit Northern Ireland next Friday for meetings with the party leaders, including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP. Mr Martin's visit will follow one by the British prime minister Boris Johnson, who is due to go to Northern Ireland on Monday, it is understood.
Senior sources in the Irish Government again expressed frustration with the British approach in recent days and privately Ministers and officials are scathing about the Johnson government, accusing it of endangering stability in Northern Ireland by playing politics with the protocol.
Some sources suggest that Dublin believes it is possible to assuage the concerns of the DUP about protocol with changes that the EU would be content with. But they have little trust that the British government would be happy with such a solution.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said that the British government would be acting in an “anti-democratic” way if it goes through with its threat to over-ride elements of the post-Brexit treaty.
Speaking on BBC Radio Four, Mr Coveney said the EU wanted to implement the Northern Ireland protocol with ""flexibility and pragmatism"" to take account of unionist concerns.
Asked what were the implications of the UK government taking unilateral action on the protocol, Mr Coveney said: ""People across the United Kingdom need to understand what that means, it means that your government is deliberately deciding to breach international law, which is something that every former prime minister still alive in Britain has warned against.
“It means that the British government would be deliberately acting in an anti-democratic way because 53 of the 90 MLAs elected to the Assembly in Northern Ireland are supportive of the protocol,” he said.
Mr Coveney added: “Don’t forget this treaty was designed and ratified and agreed by the British government under this prime minister.
“He stood for election and got a huge mandate from the British people on the back of that deal and now is blaming the deal for the problems in Northern Ireland.”
However, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the EU was trying to make the UK “feel bad” about Brexit through its approach to dealing with the Northern Ireland protocol.

Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Tuesday said the Government was examining ways to offset the impact of next month's carbon tax increase in an attempt to ensure nobody is worse off after it kicks in.
Mr Varadkar said pay policy, welfare and pensions, reducing the burden of taxation and examining costs to households that can be impacted by Government measures were part of the solution. He referenced the cost of healthcare, childcare, public transport, housing and higher education as examples.
“The best thing we can do for people is to try and make sure that they have more disposable income and that the cost of things that we have influence over comes down,” he said, adding that adjusting Vat rates could help to “treat the symptoms but doesn’t deal with the underlying cause”.
Speaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald told Mr Martin that raising the tax rise was “the wrong decision at the wrong time”.
She said it was “neither intelligent nor sensible to add any level of additional cost” to people’s home heating expenses at a time of soaring inflation when workers and families “are already struggling to keep on top of their soaring energy bills”.
“Instead of supporting households, your Government will ratchet up pressure on families with a tax hike that adds to the already unaffordable price of home heating fuels,” she said.
Mr Martin said Ms McDonald’s response was “political and electoral and nothing more”.
“Any increase in the carbon tax will be offset, so there will be no additional cost to people,” he said.
The Taoiseach said there needed to be “an inclusive process” which involved climate change related considerations. He noted this week’s report from the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change which warned “it’s now or never to avoid climate catastrophe”.
“The United Nations chief António Guterres called out double speak on climate and he said some governments and business leaders are saying one thing but doing another. Simply put they are lying and the results would be catastrophic,” Mr Martin told the Sinn Féin leader.
“I think that is the view of a number of people in this House, including the Sinn Féin party, they double speak on climate. It seems to me that it is very much the St Augustine approach you’re taking to climate change; ‘Oh Lord make me chaste, but not yet’, that is your approach.”
Earlier, Mr Varadkar had said that while the increase associated with the carbon tax hike was not large - around €20 to the cost of filling a tank of home heating oil or €1.50 to a monthly gas bill - it was “a lot of money if you don’t have it, and of course that comes on top of increases that have happened to date”.
Mr Martin said that the Government cannot deal with the fallout from post-pandemic inflationary cycles, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, on a ""week to week basis"".
“As a Government, and as a society more importantly, we have to stand back and assess the enormity of all that, acknowledging uncertainty from now until the end of the year at a minimum and take a considered and inclusive approach to how we respond to all of this,” he said.

THE COST OF living has increased in a number of ways recently and the government is still considering further measures to try and ease costs for households.
The Irish Times reported yesterday that the Environment Minister Eamon Ryan is preparing plans to help that will include encouraging people to take shorter showers and cut down on their car journeys to save costs.
Asked about advice like this, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that “energy efficiency makes sense at any time”.
It comes on the foot ofanother significant UN climate reportthat emphasised the world has the tools and knowledge to combat the climate crisis – it just needs to turn them into action, with less than three years to halt the rise in carbon emissions.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has described anti-gay andtransgendercomments made by a Kerry priest as ‘wrong’, ‘hurtful’ and ‘not the language of Christianity’.
Mr Martin is the latest in a string of Government politicians and members of the clergy to denounce the claim by Fr Seán Sheehy that gay politicians and those who support same-sex marriage will go to hell if they ‘don’t repent on sin and seek forgiveness’.
Bishop of Kerry Ray Browne has also apologised for Fr Sheehy’s Sunday homilies in Listowel that condemned transgenderism, abortion, same-sex couples, and supplying condoms to teenagers.
The Taoiseach said: ‘Those remarks were wrong, very disturbing, pretty hurtful to people generally, and in the LGBTQI community.’
Mr Martin is the latest in a string of Government politicians to denounce the claim by Father Seán Sheehy that gay politicians and those who support same-sex marriage will go to hell
He continued: ‘In my view the language used was not the language of Christianity, and certainly would seem to me to be the language of exclusion as opposed to inclusion.
'I think many people were taken aback by that.’
A spokesman for the openly gay Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said earlier this week that he ‘profoundly disagrees’ with Fr Sheehy’s views but ‘respects his right to express his religious beliefs freely’.
‘The Tánaiste does not believe that gay people will go to hell for being who they are, nor does he believe that any man or woman can make such a judgment,’ the spokesman said.
‘As Pope Francis said, “Who are we to judge?”’
Last Sunday, Fr Sheehy – deputising for Listowel parish priest Fr Declan O’Connell, who is on a pilgrimage – declared in his homily: ‘You rarely hear about sin, but it’s rampant, it’s rampant.
Father Sheehy (pictured) condemned transgenderism, abortion, same-sex couples, and supplying condoms to teenagers
'We see it in the legislation of our Government.
'We see it in the promotion of abortion. We see it for example in this lunatic approach to transgenderism.
‘We see it, for example, in the promotion of sex between two men and two women. That is sinful. That is a mortal sin and people don’t seem to realise it.
‘It’s a fact, a reality, and we need to listen to God about it because if we don’t, then there is no hope for those people.’
He later insisted that he stood by his remarks, explaining: ‘I do, because it is based on the scriptures and the teaching of the Church.’
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Bishop of Kerry said: ‘I am aware of the deep upset and hurt caused by the contents of the homilies in question delivered over the weekend.
‘I apologise to all who were offended. The views expressed do not represent the Christian position. The homily at a regular weekend parish Mass is not appropriate for such issues to be spoken of in such terms.’
Fr Sheehy appears to be aware of the storm of controversy his comments provoked, saying in church earlier this week that what he had said in the sermons was the truth.
It was reported that he got a round of applause from some church-goers, but that not everyone joined in.
Fr Sheehy is a retired priest, who spent most of his working life in the United States, returning to his native Co. Kerry in 2007 from his final post in Louisiana.
He was one of two priests assigned to Kerry parishes on a loan basis from their US dioceses, due to the chronic shortage of priests in Ireland.
Less than two years later, he provoked outrage and was forced to resign his post after providing a character reference for a man convicted of sexually assaulting a woman.
Fr Sheehy described the man as being always respectful of women, and maintained there was ‘not an abusive bone in his body’.
The priest was one of dozens of people who queued to embrace and shake hands with the convicted man before he was sentenced to seven years in jail.
The then Bishop of Kerry, Bill Murphy, issued a statement in which he said he wished to disassociate himself and the diocese from the actions and statements made by Fr Sheehy.

,UK protocol policy an act of ‘economic vandalism’ on North - Taoiseach,Micheál Martin says the legislation is ‘deeply concerning’ industry and businesses in Northern Ireland,https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/06/19/uk-protocol-policy-is-an-act-economic-vandalism-on-north-taoiseach/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-06-19T10:09:51+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said UK government legislation to scrap the bulk of Brexit’s Northern Ireland protocol represents “economic vandalism” on the region.
“The unilateral decision of the British government to bring in legislation to undermine or to give the power to undermine almost all aspects of the protocol is not acceptable,” Mr Martin told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.
“It represents unilateralism of the worst kind in terms of honouring and adhering to international agreements that governments adhere to and sign up to and ratify in their parliaments.
“We accept fully there are legitimate issues around the operation of the protocol and we believe with serious, sustained negotiations between the European Union and United Kingdom government those issues could be resolved.”
He said the legislation is “deeply concerning” industry and businesses in Northern Ireland.
[Explainer: How does the UK want to change the Northern Ireland protocol?Opens in new window]
[Brexit: What does the EU think of UK law to override NI’s trade rules?Opens in new window]
“In effect it represents a form of economic vandalism on Northern Ireland because if we look at any objective data, it is now showing that the Northern Ireland economy is doing very well. Manufacturing is doing very well,” Mr Martin added. “The dairy industry, the meat industry, the food industry generally and agriculture is doing very well. There are certain areas where we can improve the protocol and we should continue to do that.”
Separately, Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill said the plan by Boris Johnson’s government “to break international law by sabotaging the protocol” could have colossal political and economic consequences.
Addressing her party’s annual Wolfe Tone commemoration in Bodenstown, Co Kildare, she said it was an “irrefutable fact” that the protocol was working. Mr Johnson’s Conservative Party was without a mandate on this island, she added.
Last week the European Commission began two new legal proceedings against Britain after London published its plans to override some post-Brexit rules governing Northern Irish trade. Mr Johnson claims his legislation is lawful in terms of international legal obligations.
Ms O’Neill also addressed the cost of living crisis in her speech, saying it was a political priority in the North. “We need to put over £400 million into people’s pockets to help deal with the cost of living, and an extra £1 billion into the health service to reduce waiting lists, support cancer and mental health services, and recruit more doctors and nurses.”
Reiterating Sinn Féin’s demand for a Border poll on Irish unity, she called on the Irish Government to start planning for constitutional change.
“We need re-entry back into the EU for all of Ireland. We need an Irish national health service, free at the point of entry. We need to tackle the climate crisis on our island. We need to end the duplication of public services. We need to maximise the full economic potential and opportunities for everyone who shares this island.
“For many people the frustration, impatience and urgency for change is growing. There is a direct challenge and responsibility on the Irish government of the day to plan for constitutional change — in order to avoid the dangers, jeopardy and pitfalls of the Brexit referendum in Britain,” she said.
In a separate interview on Sunday, the Taoiseach rejected suggestions the structure of the political institutions of Northern Ireland and the Belfast Agreement itself were no longer fit for purpose. However, he said “fresh thinking” was needed in terms of how the Executive and the Assembly worked.
Speaking to On the Record with Gavan Reilly on Newstalk, Mr Martin said the assembly election was fought on the existing structures and those elections should be honoured.
“And it means Sinn Féin should have the first minister, and the deputy first minister goes to the DUP.
“But the point I would make is that before the next assembly election, it does need to be reviewed and examined and debated between all of the parties in Northern Ireland because the politics are changing.
“I do think it needs fresh thinking in terms of how the executive and the Assembly work more effectively than it has over the lifetime of the Good Friday Agreement because there has been too much start-stop, and pulling down the executive, when one group didn’t get its way.”

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said Government will lead on ending bad behaviour and violence towards women.
Martin, speaking on tonight’s Late Late Show, said that the murder of Ashling Murphy in Tullamore had provoked a “powerful act of solidarity” by the Irish people to support the Murphy family.
He said that there must now be an effort to remove a culture of misogynistic violence out of Irish society.
“It is a devastation we all feel in our own homes. That someone so young, so beautiful, so talented with so much to give to our society has been taken away.
“She was a talented musician, a talented camogie player, obviously a talented teacher.
“For me I just visualise the classroom for those pupils I have a passion for education.
“See the smiles on the faces of the kids when she walked in to that classroom, the affirmation she would bring to the classroom and all that’s been taken away. And I think people are saying that people are reflecting on all of that and saying enough is enough and this cannot happen and should not happen again,” he said.

The Taoiseach said that work was underway on a “major strategy” to deal with violence against women through domestic violence, sexual violence and gender based violence.
“Helen McEntee is overseeing that with Roderic O’Gorman. They have been in touch with all of the stakeholders over the last 12 months and substantive work has been done.
“That’s one level to get a strategic focus as a country, but it has to be a cultural change.
“It has to happen not just at Government level, it is for lead agencies, to people, to families and community, we have to call out the undermining of women and any violence, of course, but beneath the layer of violence, if I may, the whole culture of misogyny, a culture of absence of parity of esteem,” he added.
The Taoiseach said that work is needed in schools but also that there needs to be greater capacity given to teachers.
“I think men want to be part of the solution. For the vast, vast, vast majority of men are repulsed by this. I think I think men need to listen more to women. We need to listen more to what women are saying to us.
“And sometimes we don’t do that in a good enough fashion. So listening is the first step.
“But I think men want to step up to the plate and make sure we can create a different kind of society where people do feel safe, and where we can transform the culture that underpins bad behaviour and violence towards women,” he added.

The island of Ireland still has plenty to learn from the events of 100 years ago, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said, in a speech marking the centenary of the handover of Dublin Castle by British forces.
Speaking at an academic conference in Dublin Castle organised by Trinity College Dublin, the Taoiseach said that it was “impossible” not to look back at the partition of the island 100 years ago and see “what we lost”.
“In almost every way possible bad faith was shown toward the nationalist majority on this island when it came to addressing partition in 1922 and the years following,” Mr Martin said.
“London’s indifference to the reality of the sectarianism faced by Northern nationalists also caused immense damage.”
The Irish Provisional Government took possession of Dublin Castle on January 16th, 1922, following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty which brought to an end the Irish war of independence against British rule.
The previous year, the British Government had partitioned the island to create Northern Ireland.

Culture Minister Catherine Martin was among the other speakers at the two-day conference.
Mr Martin on Saturday referred to the “deep and lasting shock” produced by partition.
“Their churches, unions, sporting organisations, legislators and much more had never before been divided in this way.
“Even for many unionists this was an unnatural divide which I believe is rightly seen as shaping much of our subsequent history – and not for the good.”
Mr Martin told the conference: “Much and all as I believe we have a right to question if they were justified, we cannot ignore the fact that there were many who feared an independent state and that this motivated their push for partition.”
The Fianna Fáil leader praised the fact that there now exists an “agreed blueprint” to decide the constitutional future of the island, and praised efforts in recent years to increase connections between both sides of the border.

But he said: “I think it is impossible to look back a century and not see what we lost.
“We lost a chance for a more diverse, challenging, creative and successful state.
“One which, with goodwill, might have found ways to lead the world in working to overcome sectarianism.”
The Taoiseach also warned of the danger of trying to “distort” history, emphasising the place of historians in the battle against “disinformation and populism”.
“Now, more than at possibly any point since the end of the Second World War, the practice of history and commemoration matters profoundly. It goes to the heart of who we are and the society we want to be,” Mr Martin said.
He told historians: “The harsh reality is that ours is a world where disinformation and populism are a very real threat to the sustainability of free democracies.

“And in fighting this threat, an absolutely essential requirement is to have a diverse range of independent historical scholarship, and to not stop at this, but to make it accessible, to support it through independently administered grants and to open archives as widely as possible.
“Above all we have to stand against attempts to distort the complex reality of our history to meet partisan needs of today.”
He criticised the altering of curriculums “to promote a more uniform and closed set of narratives about the past”.
“Different countries are seeing calls for ‘patriotic history’ to be taught. New monuments are being erected to focus on reopening historic grievances,” he said.
Ireland is preparing to mark and commemorate a difficult period in its history, with divisions over the Anglo-Irish Treaty turning violent and culminating in the outbreak of civil war in 1922.
Mr Martin referenced these divisions, which defined Irish politics for decades, in his speech.
“The process of establishing a new state began here on January 16 but was not fully completed until December 6,” he told the conference.
“Between those two dates a remarkable number of decisions were taken and events occurred which had profound implications for the future of our country.
“The British did not leave on January 16, and the nature of the withdrawal during the year is something which deserves more attention for its impact on the divisions within the country.
“And of course, the drift towards, and sudden outbreak, of civil war casts a shadow over everything.”
He continued: “When the lord lieutenant greeted the new provisional government and formally began the transfer of power it was a moment which marked a once unthinkable success for Irish nationalism and republicanism.
“It was not a moment of unity, but it simply could not have occurred without the broadly-based revolution which had proceeded it.”
Mr Martin said that Ireland had conducted a “meaningful and respectful” approach to commemoration in recent years.
Ireland is coming towards the end of a so-called “decade of centenaries”, which began in 2012 and has seen a range of events and commemorations take place marking Ireland’s journey towards independence.
“I am very conscious that there is a delicate balance to be found in a free democracy between appropriate commemoration and the promotion of a fixed national narrative,” Mr Martin said.
“Every state has a right to remember and honour its founders and the traditions which both won the support of the people and secured progress.
“However, this can never be allowed to become inflexible and closed to new perspectives. It must respect the fact that diverse societies allow open, reflective debate.”

It’s been one setback after another for Micheál Martin. But now, finally, he’s caught a break. Out through the gap at long, long last.
We thought he was going to cry.
In his first good news address to the nation since taking office in the middle of a pandemic, a mightily relieved Taoiseach stood at the doors of Government Buildings and declared a new Independence Day for Ireland. The timing was felicitous, falling exactly 103 years to the day in 1919 when the first Dáil met and declared the fledgling nation's independence.
“Spring is coming and I don’t know if I have ever looked forward to one as much as I am looking forward to this one,” he said from his familiar spot at the foot of the steps. “We need to see each other again, we need to see each other smile, we need to sing again.”
It must have been such a welcome change from the usual Friday night dampeners with their promises of better things to come sinking in the infectious gloom of further restrictions and impositions. And while Micheál’s deep sigh as he prepared to speak indicated a weight lifting off his shoulders, the strain of trying to keep the show on the road for so long was apparent too.
“You responded, you did what you had to do,” he told the people. “We have weathered the Omicron storm.”
Liberty at last.
“Today is a good day,” declared Micheál.
When his eyes watered when he talked of spring and all the good things to come, he wasn't the only person feeling a little emotional
And the entire country exhaled with him.
Sing, did he say?
He didn’t. Not even a few bars of De Banks.
There was disappointment when he didn’t even throw in a quote from Meat Loaf. (Leo Varadkar would have.)
But it was a minor quibble. And when Micheál’s voice quivered as he spoke of the loved ones who died in the past two, difficult, years, who could blame him? Or when his eyes watered when he talked of spring and all the good things to come, he wasn’t the only person feeling a little emotional.
At the press conference afterwards, the mood had considerably lightened. The announcement made and the reawakening underway.
Tony Holohan said he plans to go to a couple of concerts and GAA matches.
Leo Varadkar has no plans to go clubbing over the weekend but he’ll chance “a quiet pint on Sunday. See how it goes.”
As for work, he’ll be looking forward to meeting all those new members of staff he has only encountered on virtual meetings. “It’s always interesting to find out who’s tall and who’s short.”
The Taoiseach is probably going to head off to Kerry, probably to take in a match in Killarney.
He won’t be going mad either. “I’ll have a pint over the weekend.”
Just to toast Independence Day.
One year on and poor Stephen Donnelly still isn't feeling the love on his own department's Twitter famine, sorry, feed.
Do they not know who he is?
Most disappointing. Not least because yer man Simon Harris, that other Minister from Wicklow, used to get loads of mentions when he was in charge at Health.
Last January, alarm bells went off at the highest level in Baggot Street when it emerged that Simon’s successor was not getting similar recognition. Obviously something needed to be done at the very highest level to address the Minister’s attention deficit problem as quickly as possible. We were, after all, in the middle of a pandemic.
Apparently the fear within Donnelly's inner sanctum was that the Department of Health's Twitter account was more Nphet-centred than Donnelly-driven
Donnelly's terrible predicament came to light in April when our Public Affairs Correspondent Simon Carswell revealed that such was the concern over the shock results of analysis carried out by the Minister's media adviser, Páraic Gallagher, it even reached the desk of secretary general Robert Watt. He wasted no time getting in touch with the department's head of communications, Deirdre Watters.
“The Minister completed an analysis of the department’s Twitter feed. There is no reference to the Minister, as you can see. We need to discuss,” he told Ms Watters in an email dated January 14th. Apparently the fear within Donnelly’s inner sanctum was that the Department of Health’s Twitter account was more Nphet-centred than Donnelly-driven, with far more mentions for Tony Holohan’s public health monitoring team than there were for Donnelly’s doings.
Has this top-level intervention worked at all for the overlooked Minister?
Well, despite all the attention and some awkward questions at the time for Donnelly in a Morning Ireland interview, further analysis by media research company Onclusive (formerly Kantar) shows that matters have not improved for him since then.
We’ve had a look at the stats.
An analysis of tweets on the Twitter accounts of Government departments since the controversy until the end of last year shows that Donnelly remains the Coalition’s lesser-spotted Minister.
He was mentioned in just 11 per cent of the department's tweets between April and December. Despite his department's best efforts, tweeting less overall but doubling the number of times it mentioned him, Donnelly was still bottom of the pile amongst his Cabinet peers. The Department of Finance may have tweeted the least of all the departments but at least it knew how to shine a spotlight, with Paschal Donohoe emerging as the Minister most mentioned in departmental tweets with a 52 per cent strike rate.
For 2021 as a whole, the strongest performer was arguably Simon Harris. With 506 mentions, spread across 200 days, the Department of Further and Higher Education mentioned him more than every other day. Funny that: Harris was the Minister Donnelly was compared against in the original analysis shared within the Department of Health.
When it comes to tweeting, it seems Stephen still has a lot to learn from his constituency rival in Wicklow.
With restrictions lifting , there is no truth in the rumour that Shane Ross, Finian McGrath, John Halligan and Kevin ""Boxer"" Moran are camping outside the gates of Leinster House in anticipation of a full reopening of facilities for former members of the Dáil next week. But, rather like the queues outside department stores before the January sales, visions of the former Independent Alliance amigos storming the members' bar as soon as the doors are opened cannot be discounted.
While the Oireachtas has yet to pronounce on revised arrangements for Leinster House, stools will be back in the Dáil bar on Monday while the catering staff are gearing up for an expected onslaught of first-time TDs and Senators when normal business resumes in the Members' Restaurant.
The Class of 2020 never got the chance to parade proud mammies and grannies around their new place of work, treating them to drinks in the Dáil bar and a slap-up meal in the VIP restaurant. As fully fledged parliamentarians – it’s a major achievement for politicians of any stripe – they haven’t been able to bring family, friends and supporters into Leinster House. It’s a special occasion for the newbies and one they have yet to enjoy.
God be with the days of the mineral and pink schnack for the school pupils and a roast lunch in the self-service canteen for confirmed voters
This also raises the question of vouchers. Many Oireachtas members buy them for meals in the Oireachtas restaurant which they then donate as raffle prizes. An awful lot of “dinner for four with deputy so-and-so in Leinster House” prizes are knocking about the place now and they will have to be honoured.
TDs and Senators are waiting with bated breath for the green light to bring back their beloved school tours and Active Age (voters’) groups. God be with the days of the mineral and pink schnack for the school pupils and a roast lunch in the self-service canteen for confirmed voters.
The transition year students and interns are also itching to get back.
But the reopening of the campus to former members and the general public will see one source of irritation returning to annoy all but one of the main parties.
Tour groups are alwayssoooexcited when they encounter the Healy-Raes and/or Mary Lou McDonald.
It drives the others nuts.
The Dáil and Seanad returned from the Christmas and New Year recess this week with the formal announcement from Government of a new public holiday in honour of St Brigid. Not before time – we now have a Biddy’s Day in February to go with a Paddy’s Day in March.
Welcoming the news, Fianna Fáil Senator Fiona O'Loughlin called it ""a great recognition for our matron saint of this country"".
She said Brigid’s values of equality, 1,500 years later, are still strong. “She was the very first feminist in this country and cared deeply for those who were downtrodden by society. She looked after both women and men equally and cared deeply for the environment, for the farming community and for the animal kingdom.”
Fiona mentioned that Kildare has a special relationship with Brigid and said that the first thing she did when elected mayor of the county ""was to put a bog oak St Brigid's cross in the chamber, where it still is and of which I am very proud. So it's very much appreciated by the people of Kildare and, I have no doubt, by the people of Ireland.""
Remember that this woman, she gouged out her eyes to make herself ugly because she didn't want unwanted attention from men
They probably appreciated the announcement too.
But Senator O'Loughlin had competition from her party colleague Erin McGreehan, who welcomed the news as not just ""a day of celebration for mná na hÉireann"" but also one for the Wee County. St Brigid, she reminded the Seanad, was a Louth woman, born over the road in Faughart.
“Remember that this woman, she gouged out her eyes to make herself ugly because she didn’t want unwanted attention from men. So that on the day that we remember St Brigid and we revel in her strength and her mightiness and how proud we are to have her as our patron saint, remember what she did to get rid of unwanted attention from men,” said Erin.
“I applaud her, although I don’t agree with it. But that’s what she did in the fifth century. So g’wan, Bríd!”

Two Government departments have offered to provide funding for a number of years to “help contribute to a sustainable model” in the gallery, he said.
""In the Department of Further and Higher Education's engagement with Trinity College Dublin, they alongside the Department of Arts . . . [have] actually offered to provide funding for a number of years to help contribute to a sustainable model in [the] Science Gallery,"" Mr Martin told the Dáil on Tuesday. ""Trinity College Dublin needs to do work to develop what a new vision and a sustainable financial model for the long-term future of the Science Gallery is. The Department of Further and Higher Education is awaiting a submission from them on those issues.
“There is a separate question around the contractual arrangements with the existing staff of the gallery and that is a matter for Trinity College and their staff.”
Mr Martin was responding to questions from Independent TD Denis Naughten, who said scientific research has been ""a key plank of Ireland's economic and industrial policy"" and also been vital in the country's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“That is down to our scientists, many of whom were inspired to go into research through their engagement with the Science Gallery in Dublin,” Mr Naughten said.
""The Science Gallery has gone international, with offshoots from the United States to Australia. But next month, the original gallery here in Ireland is set to shut its doors for the very last time, undermining our strategy as a country to position itself as a world leader in science and technology.
“Reading between the lines, it seems the Department of Further Education and the Department of Tourism are in dispute as to who will contribute to the operational shortfall. This short-sighted internal bickering needs to stop and the doors kept open for Ireland’s sake.”
Trinity College last year informed the gallery’s 16 staff members of its decision to close the facility on Pearse Street due to unsustainable losses. However, once news of the closure plan was made public, the Government stepped in to see if it could be rescued.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he hopes “in-person” St Patrick Day events can resume this year “if it is safe to do so”.
Last year, due to Covid-19, the Taoiseach held virtual meetings with US President Joe Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
It is understood that work has begun between Irish officials and their US counterparts behind the scenes on plans for this year’s visit to the White House in Washington DC.
When asked in the Dáil today about expanding Ireland’s Global Ireland plan which involves doubling  Ireland’s global footprint abroad through a series of new embassies and promoting cultural programmes overseas, the Taoiseach said:
“As the House will be aware, as a result of the pandemic it was not possible to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day in the traditional way last year, with most events moving online.
“We hope that it may be possible to resume some in-person events this year, depending on public health developments, which remain the most important consideration.”

Last year, Biden received the traditional bowl of shamrock in the Oval office, and during the shamrock handover the US president said it is a “great tradition” that “goes all the way back to Harry Truman”.
The US president referenced his own Irish-American heritage and reiterated his administration’s support for the Good Friday Agreement.
The Taoiseach said today that this year will mark the 13th Tourism Ireland Global Greening, which saw a record 725 sites and landmarks in 71 countries take part in 2021.
While it is tradition for Ministers and Ministers of State to travel to different destinations around the globe to mark St Patrick’s Day, it is expected that the missions will be scaled back somewhat this year, given the public health concerns.
However, it is believed that the Taoiseach could take part in an extended visit to the US this year in the run up to St Patrick’s Day, but will return home in time for the pandemic commemoration event which is due to take place on Sunday 20 March.
This will Martin’s last opportunity as Taoiseach to visit with the US president before the rotation of Leo Varadkar into the role in December 2022.
The Government has announced that a double public holiday will take place on 17 and 18 March this year.

Speaking in France on Friday, Micheál Martin said he was impatient to see progress on the matter.
His comments came after The Irish Timesrevealed this weekthat a HSE licence for the new maternity hospital will include legal measures requiring it to provide all medical procedures allowed under Irish law.
This followed recent Government moves to reopen a draft relocation agreement in which the Elm Park site in south Dublin for the new hospital will come under State control for 299 years after the site’s transfer to the NMH from St Vincent’s Healthcare Group.
An informed source said the agreement, which has still to go to Cabinet for approval, will be changed to include specific provisions to reflect the fact that procedures at the new hospital will include “anything permissible within Irish law”.
Although the plan to move the NMH from Holles Street in central Dublin to the site on the St Vincent’s campus has been in train since 2013, the project has been mired in controversy for years.
The Religious Sisters of Charity are due to transfer the ownership of lands at St Vincent's to an independent entity, which will then lease the new maternity hospital site to the State. But critics have claimed for years that a Catholic religious ethos would live on for the new hospital, possibly compromising its power to carry out procedures such as pregnancy termination and sterilisation.
Minister of State at the Department of Health Anne Rabbitte said last month that while concerns ""continue to circulate"" in relation to the potential involvement of the Religious Sisters of Charity in the new maternity hospital, the order would not play any role in the governance or operation of the hospital.
On Friday, Mr Martin said of the talks on a relocation deal: “We are at an advanced stage and a memo hasn’t been brought to Government yet, but I am aware that a lot of work has gone on behind the scenes with the Minister and Department [of Health] and with all the stakeholders involved here. We do need a new national maternity hospital.
“The current situation is simply not good enough in terms of women’s health, and I’m very anxious now that we get moving on this project because generally speaking, health projects are taking too long to get off the ground, to get designed, to get built. I am impatient for progress on this.”
He said there will be a memo to Cabinet “shortly” but would not be drawn on the exact date.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin said last week that the Government will consider Nphet advice on the wearing of face masks for the rest of the population more generally and make a decision accordingly. He said it would be his preference, however, that people continue to wear masks in retail settings and on public transport in the immediate future.
Government sources said on Monday night that Ministers were likely to move quickly on any Nphet recommendation to end the requirement for children to wear masks in school. Older children have been wearing masks in class since September 2020, while the requirement for primary schoolchildren aged over nine was introduced last December.
Sources stressed that the Government decision would depend on Nphet advice but there is a clear preference emerging among senior Government figures to end the rule on masks, as the pandemic recedes and society returns to normal. Covid case numbers have fallen sharply since the Omicron wave peaked in mid-January, while the numbers in hospital and intensive care units have also declined steadily.
On Monday there were 665 people in hospital with Covid and 67 patients in intensive care units.
The Department of Health on Monday reported a total of 3,494 new PCR-confirmed cases.
On Sunday, February 13th, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) was notified of 4,331 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19. In addition, 3,609 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.
On Saturday, February 12th, the HPSC was notified of 4,940 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 2,950 people registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.
All remaining Covid-19 legal restrictions are to be lifted from Tuesday in Northern Ireland.
In Dublin it is expected the Government will hold a special meeting, likely to take place late next week, to map out a pandemic plan for the coming months.
Sources said that a more restrictive testing regime would be considered, which could see only the very sick tested for Covid-19.
This could mean that people who have mild symptoms of Covid-19 would not be tested for the virus. Ministers are also likely to discuss the rules around isolation, a source said. The Government is keen to put in place a new vaccination framework which could see Covid-19 treated much like the flu virus. Under this plan, most people would only be offered one vaccination appointment every year, potentially in the lead-up to the winter period.

“We’re going to have a meeting shortly, a Covid meeting within Government, just to try to take stock of the situation and map out the situation for the remainder of the year. And we just had a preliminary chat with some of the heads of state earlier this morning in terms of how things are going in their country,” he said.
“The World Health Organisation seemed pleased with developments as were some of my colleagues.”
Mr Martin said the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will meet in the coming weeks to discuss the remaining restrictions including the wearing of face masks.
He said, however, that it is his personal view that people should continue to wear masks on public transport and in retail outlets.
“Nphet will be meeting in respect of the mask mandate and so on by the end of the month,” he said.
“Irrespective of whether it is mandated or not, I would recommend that people would wear masks in retail and public transport for some time yet.
“It’s a personal view I have. Decisions will be taken on the mandatory nature of masks; if they are no longer necessary, they are no longer necessary and people will no longer have to wear them.
“But we’ve learned lessons too from Covid and I think we need to adapt some of them. Particularly in the winter periods when viruses are stronger and more dangerous.”
Mr Martin said that, overall, “the news is good” in respect of the Omicron variant.
“We have to be mindful of other variants. I think the emphasis now is to make sure we continue our investment in public health and that we have systems in place that are resilient and adaptable to any future outbreaks and maybe of other variants.”
He said that was also the case in relation to the structures in place for future vaccination campaigns.
“It also relates to the vaccination structures that we have so that we can respond again and are in a position, particularly towards the latter part of the year, in terms of vaccinating particularly the more vulnerable groups in our society. Niac is looking at that whole vaccination issue and whether or not we get to a situation where there would be an annual Covid vaccine.”

Political Correspondent Christina Finn reporting from the United States.
US PRESIDENT JOE Biden has commended Ireland for the number of Ukrainian refugees it has taken in since the conflict broke out in the eastern European country.
He made the comments during a traditional St Patrick’s Day meeting with the Taoiseach, which was held via video conference after Micheál Martin tested positive for Covid-19 last night.
Speaking online, Biden confirmed that he met Martin “for seven-and-a-half minutes” yesterday at the Ireland Funds dinner, just before the Taoiseach’s Covid-19 diagnosis was confirmed.
The Taoiseach, who is currently isolating in Blair House across the road from the White House, made light of his diagnosis after being unable to meet Biden last year because of the pandemic.
“Last year we met virtually across the Atlantic; this year we’re meeting virtually across the road. So we’re getting closer,” he said. “It’s unfortunate, but no more than that.”
Sitting beside a bowl of shamrock in the Oval Office, Biden spoke about the crisis in Ukraine, and complemented Ireland’s policy towards accepting Ukrainian refugees
“I want to publicly compliment you for it. I think you’ve already brought in over 7,000 or so refugees from Ukraine, and you’re prepared to do more. So, thank you, thank you,” he said.
“It’s our duty,” the Taoiseach replied.
Biden told the Taoiseach that the Irish “occasionally kid” that the he is always referencing Irish poets, before he cited a line from WB Yeats’ poem Easter, 1916 that ”all is changed, changed utterly” in reference to the crisis in Ukraine.
“I think that your leadership on the global stage has really been noticeable and impressive… your leadership on the global stage within the EU as well. And your condemnation of Putin’s aggression in support of the sanctions,” Biden said.
“It’s costing Ireland, it’s costing Ireland, but as usual, you’re basing it on principle of moral standing of a country.”
In a speech given at the Capitol Hill lunch, Biden continued to address the issues in Ukraine, stating that Ireland has “taken a hit” for stepping up to help the war in Ukraine.
“Now you have Ireland and Great Britain standing together against a murderous dictator, a pure thug, who is waging an immoral war against the Ukraine,” he said.
“The Republic is paying a big price for supporting the strategy, for supporting the sanctions,” he said, adding “it’s not a minor contribution”.
“Everybody talks about Germany having stepped up and changed motions about being more leaning forward and they have, so has Ireland, a neutral country,” said Biden.
“Ireland has stepped up and taken a hit for what they’re doing.”
He also said that Putin is paying a “big price for his aggression” and that Ireland is “part of the reason why the cost is going so high”.

He said that the US and Ireland are working together for the first time on the UN Security Council in a relationship which is “dynamic”.
Biden told Ambassador Mulhall that Ireland is a “real actor” on the world stage.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also addressed the event, paying tribute to the Taoiseach for his role in “promoting peace” in Ukraine. She also said that the the world was in awe of how he handled the pandemic and the Irish economy during Brexit.
She also mentioned in her speech his “reinvigoration of the government’s focus on housing and healthcare”.
Pelosi also read out a poem she said Bono sent her this morning.
“Ireland’s sorrow and pain is now the Ukraine and Saint Patrick’s name now Zelenskyy.”

Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald and MLA Michelle O’Neill also attended the lunch in Capitol Hill.
Good Friday Agreement
The US president also reiterated his support for the Good Friday Agreement today, saying he had raised it with the UK.
“I also want to emphasise this administration’s unequivocal support for the Good Friday accords, for the Good Friday Agreement. I’ve made that clear, as you probably heard, to the Prime Minister [Boris Johnson] and others,” Biden said.
“I think it’s too much blood, sweat and tears have been shed to get that done. And this is no time to change it.”
Biden said he and the Taoiseach would discuss ways to deepen the cooperation between Ireland the United States, bilaterally through the European Union, on issues such as “taking on climate change”, and by “looking at economic opportunities”.
He said that both himself and Martin have been fighting Covid-19, and that they will “work closely together” on the dealing with the pandemic.
Biden finished by giving his best wishes to the Taoiseach, saying: “I know you’re looking good, feeling good.”
Taoiseach: 'Last year, we met virtually across the Atlantic. This year, we're meeting virtually across the road. So we're getting closer. But I'm feeling good and I think that reminds us of the importance of vaccines.'pic.twitter.com/iti1P0ZRhZ— Christina Finn (@christinafinn8)March 17, 2022

He said he was looking to the Taoiseach making a recovery.
Speaking further about Ukraine, the Taoiseach said Russia’s invasion was an “unjustifiable and immoral war on the people by the regime of Vladimir Putin”.
“I think it’s extremely important that we keep this unity of purpose over the coming while and Ireland stands ready to do everything we possibly can,” he said.
Martin expressed Irish support for “the broadest and widest sanctions possible to keep the pressure on and to get this war ended”.

He said there was “too much suffering” and that it is “heart-rendering to see the appalling loss of life, and also the terrible trauma on the children of Ukraine and their mothers as they flee this war zone”.
“We’re very seized by this in Ireland,” Martin added.
Ireland Funds dinner
The virtual meeting came after the Taoiseach tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday.
He initially tested negative on an antigen test, after being alerted that a member of his delegation had received a positive result. However, a follow-up PCR test came back positive for the Taoiseach.
Martin had also received a negative PCR test result on Sunday before travelling to the US.
The announcement of the positive test was made during the ceremony last night in Washington DC where the Taoiseach was due to receive a leadership award.
The Irish ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall, made the announcement at the gala event, when he had to step in and accept a leadership award on behalf of Martin.
The Taoiseach was already in attendance at the dinner yesterday evening, and seated beside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi before the result of his second Covid test came through.
Pelosi said in a press conference today that after consulting with a doctor, she will continue to test regularly and follow public health advice.
She said the Friends of Ireland lunch at Capitol Hill will go ahead today, as planned, though the Taoiseach will not be able to attend.
Pelosi also told reporters that she was not worried about her health after being seated with the Taoiseach yesterday evening.
She said she gets tested almost every day as she is in regular contact with the president.
Biden will still make his trip to Capitol Hill for the Friends of Ireland lunch, which is hosted by Pelosi each year. The Irish Ambassador to the US Dan Mulhall will attend in the Taoiseach’s place.
The usual evening shamrock reception at the White House is still expected to take place, though the Taoiseach will be absent.
On this St. Patrick’s Day, I’m hosting a virtual bilat with Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland. I look forward to reaffirming the close and historic partnership between the United States and Ireland and the extraordinary bonds between our people.— President Biden (@POTUS)March 17, 2022

The President and the First Lady are also set to host the traditional Shamrock presentation at the East Room of the White House.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden met virtually Thursday with Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin after the visiting leader’s positive test for COVID-19 scrambled plans to mark St. Patrick’s Day at the White House.
“I’m really deeply sorry for the inconvenience that we have to meet virtually this year,” Biden said to Martin, who dialed in by video link while isolating at Blair House across the street from the White House. The traditional crystal bowl of shamrocks gifted to the U.S. president was displayed next to the television monitor set up next to Biden’s chair in the oval office.
“I’m doing good, and I think that reminds of the vaccines and that the vaccines prevent severe illness,” Martin told Biden.
Biden and Martin joined to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has jolted the world and brought the U.S. and its European allies to unite in condemnation and in placing stiff sanctions on Russia.
“We have to be united,” Biden said. “We certainly are. But Putin’s brutality and what his troops are doing in Ukraine is just inhumane.”
Martin said he wanted salute Biden’s leadership in marshaling democracies against what he called an “unjustifiable and immoral war,” “It’s firm, it’s determined, it’s measured, it’s strong,” Martin said.
Biden also reaffirmed U.S. support for the Good Friday accords, which were signed in 1998 and helped end sectarian violence that had raged for three decades over the issue of Northern Ireland unifying with Ireland or remaining part of the United Kingdom.
The virtual meeting kicked off the first in a day-long set of festivities that have been reimagined after the Irish leader’s diagnosis.
Martin sat out out the annual “Friends of Ireland Luncheon” at the Capitol, hosted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that Biden attended. Biden will go ahead with a White House reception planned for Thursday evening, but Martin will not participate.
Martin learned he had tested positive for COVID-19 Wednesday evening while attending an event with Biden and Pelosi, but the White House said the president was not considered a close-contact of Martin — also referred to as Ireland’s taoiseach.
Pelosi said she sat with the Taoiseach at the dinner. She said he was wearing a mask but took it off as they sat together to eat. It was during the appetizer when he was called aside. He later left the table, right before she was to present him with an award.
All three leaders are vaccinated and boosted.
As for her own health, Pelosi said she is tested almost every day, and will continue following the guidelines from the Capitol’s Office of the Attending Physician on COVID-19. She said she did not count the minutes she sat with the Irish leader.
Biden, meanwhile, said he was glad to briefly see Martin “for seven and a half minutes” at the event.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines “close contact” with an infected person as spending 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. The CDC says people with “close contact” does not need to quarantine if they are up to date on their vaccines, but they should wear a well-fitting mask around other people for 10 days after their contact.
“We’re very, very sad that on St. Patrick’s Day the Taoiseach has this diagnosis,” Pelosi said.

Introducing Biden at the lunch, Pelosi joked that while she is Italian herself, “I do have Irish grandchildren.” She led the bipartisan crowd in toast to Biden’s health after the president’s remarks.
Pelosi used the experience to push additional federal COVID-19 aid after a funding package sought by Biden fell apart last week. She noted that former President Barack Obama had recently tested positive for the virus as well and questioned how people with fewer resources would fare.
“We want to move on, but we don’t want to move on and leave people behind,” she said. “We need the money.”
This year marks the Irish-American Biden’s second St. Patrick’s Day in office, but his first with substantial in-person events after last year’s celebrations were suspended by the pandemic.

In a statement on Wednesday, his spokesman said: “The Taoiseach will attend an important meeting of the European Council in Brussels tomorrow which will discuss Russian military aggression against Ukraine, security and defence, energy, economic issues, Covid-19 and external relations.
“He has now received two successive negative Covid tests ahead of his departure from the US, and he will fly home from Washington DC this evening.”
It is understood that the Taoiseach’s camp consulted with Aer Lingus, Irish public health officials, Belgian authorities and the European Union, and was advised that they follow the same advice of waiting seven days from a positive test.
Mr Martin is said to be feeling well and is symptom free and will be wearing a mask while in Brussels.
Had he been unable to travel, Mr Martin would not have been able to nominate a deputy or an official to attend in his stead, as European Council rules stipulate that only heads of Government can attend the sessions.
US president Joe Biden is also travelling to Brussels for the summit to discuss the west’s next moves in reaction to the Russian invasion.
Ahead of the two-day meeting, there have been calls from the Opposition and lobby groups for a cut in the VAT rate on fuel, a move the Government has resisted out of concern at losing a derogation for the current Irish rate from the EU.
Asked if a VAT cut could happen, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “I think any further actions like reduction in VAT would have to be something that we do on a European level.
“We’ve already reduced excise considerably and I think that has helped to mitigate the increase in the price of petrol, the price of diesel.”
On whether he expected the issue to come up at the European Council meeting, he said there would certainly be discussion about further action that the EU could take to reduce the cost of energy and fuel and electricity in particular.
The summit of leaders of EU member states takes place in the buildings of the Council of the European Union in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.

During his visit to Berlin on Tuesday, Mr Martin praised Ms Dixon's ""competence and ability"" and suggested her critics ""may be doing this for their own interests"".
“I don’t readily agree with a lot of the arguments put forward in the first instance. I think we need a more objective assessment of this,” said Mr Martin.
Jens Zimmermann, digital spokesman for Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD), has flagged Ireland's approach to data protection as a growing burden to Ireland's reputation in Germany, similar to that caused by its corporate tax policy.
Criticism of the Irish regulator has been building in the EU over the past four years since a new EU data protection rulebook (GDPR) came into force in 2018, handing Dublin the lead regulatory role in policing large Dublin-based tech companies such as Facebook.
On Monday Ms Dixon’s office announced it had issued a revised preliminary decision in a long-running legal battle that is expected to halt transatlantic data transfers by Facebook.
Last year, as criticism grew of the pace of rulings from the commission around Europe, the Dáil justice committee held a hearing and, in July, recommended a full examination of the office's procedures by the Department of Justice.
As a matter of urgency, the committee urged the data protection commission to provide greater clarity over its procedures and shift from “recommendations to enforcement” of data protection laws. Failure to do so, it added, would mean “that not only will the fundamental rights of individuals remain imperilled, but the DPC will face a more emboldened and entrenched group of systematic infringers”.
Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, Mr Martin said Europe needed a wider debate on data protection issues and that he didn’t have an exact time for any Department of Justice review of DPC procedures.
The Irish Council of Civil Liberties (ICCL) has flagged the issue with EU ombudsman Emily O’Reilly. She has begun an investigation into the European Commission’s approach to data protection and whether it believes GDPR rules are “applied in all respects in Ireland”.
ICCL fellow Johnny Ryan said that millions of Europeans relied on Ireland to ""see that Google and Facebook stop misusing their personal data"".
“This is a critically important issue of fundamental rights,” he said.
Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems, a vocal critic of the DPC, said he was not impressed with Mr Martin's remarks.
“Instead of addressing objective criticism, such as how more than 99 per cent of all complaints to the DPC do not see a formal decision, we see deflection,” he said. “I doubt that European partners will be impressed.
European Commissioner Didier Reynders, in a letter to MEPs last month, said the DPC was right to proceed cautiously in cases, including the “complex matter” of its Facebook investigation.
He acknowledged that there were “different views and approaches” around Europe on how best to implement GDPR.

LAST UPDATE|24 Feb 2022
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said that Ireland will be supporting the “strongest possible” sanctions by the EU on Russia, following the invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels this evening, Martin said that the EU collectively condemned the “outrageous and immoral attack” on Ukraine by Russia.
Martin is in Brussels as part of a snap EU summit on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which was called yesterday evening in advance of the invasion.
Earlier today he said Ireland’s thoughts “must be with the innocent people of Ukraine in their most difficult hour”.
“We stand with them,” he said, addingthat visa requirements would be waivedfor all Ukrainians entering this country.  He said this should help Irish families in Ukraine to travel to Ireland with Ukrainian family members.
“As a small country in particular, today’s use of brute force in pursuit of a warped perception of national interest is a serious affront. It presents Europe with the most grave security situation it has faced in decades, with repercussions for global security and for the world’s economy,” he said.
Sanctions
Speaking in Brussels, Martin said that Ireland supported the “strongest possible” sanctions on Russia.
“We will support the imposition of comprehensive and severe sanctions on Russia, sanctions that reflect the grave nature of the assault on the Ukrainian people.
“We will be supporting the strongest possible and most comprehensive sanctions that can be deployed.
“Particularly in the financial sector, in energy and transport and in a range of sectors that would weaken the industrial base of Russia and also its capacity to wage war.”
When asked about excluding Russia from the SWIFT banking system, Martin repeated that Ireland backed the strongest possible sanctions.
He also added that a €10 million fund for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine would be created by the Government and that Ireland would stand by to do whatever else is needed to assist Ukraine “in their hour of need”.
Martin also confirmed that Ireland would not recognise a government in Ukraine that was installed by Russia.
Impact of sanctions
Speaking toRTÉ Radio Onethis afternoon, Martin said that there would be a cost to the sanctions issued by the EU on Ireland, with damage to the economy and an increased price and scarcity of energy also raised.
“The general price will be one of economic challenges. Energy is an obvious one in terms of the increased price and scarcity of sources of energy, in terms of gas and oil.
“Contingency measures have been taken at European level in respect of some of that, but I think we have to be honest with people. In upholding the values that we cherish there will be a price and there will be a cost.”
He said that there would likely be higher costs for EU countries who are closer to the conflict.
When asked if the Russian Ambassador to Ireland will be expelled, he said no one EU country will take unilateral steps: “We will work in concert and in unity with our European colleagues…no one country will be taking unilateral steps.”
Martin said that Ambassador Yuri Filatov “represents a government which has lied to the world” and people they have engaged with.
“American intelligence, and NATO intelligence let’s be frank, has been saying for quite some time that this was going to happen. This was denied, emphatically denied by the Ambassador and by representatives of the Russian government, even though they clearly were planning such a comprehensive attack on the Ukrainian people,” Martin said.
Invasion
Russia launched an assaulton its neighbour at approximately 5am local time (3am Irish time).

Martin said that there will be a “clear, comprehensive and immediate” response to the “unjust aggression” by Russia against the people of the Ukraine. “It is immoral what is going on,” he said.

'Why does one leader decide that lives will be lost...it's immoral.'pic.twitter.com/W5Ymg1UaMu
Martin said the protection of human life “is extremely important” and that Ireland will not be found wanting in offering the humanitarian support the Ukrainian people will need.
Preparations are currently underway to prepare for a potential humanitarian crisis, and Martin said Ireland is drawing up plans to receive potential Ukrainian refugees.
“Plans being worked on if that turns out to be the case. War can, as we know, create real pressures in terms of migratory flows. We hope again it doesn’t come to that.
“I think we have to do everything we possibly can in this situation, to reach out to our Ukrainian friends. We will be there for them.”
Martin said that the Irish Government is maintaining close contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine.
“We are also maintaining close contact with Irish citizens in Ukraine, whose safety is paramount, including the two Irish diplomats in our Embassy in Kyiv who are in a safe place with EU colleagues. I pay tribute to their commitment and to the work that they are doing,” he said.
Martin said that while there is lots of talk about strategies and geopolitics, “fundamentally it’s people’s lives that are at stake here”.
“Young lives will be lost unnecessarily,” he told reporters. This is an “unacceptable” situation to be witnessing in the 21st century, he said.
The Taoiseach said he agrees with EU Council President Ursula von der Leyen when she said the target is no longer just Ukraine. “One has to take into consideration that the expansionist position of President Putin could be to push further,” he added.
The Taoiseach said if it is the case that Putin wants to “restore some previous historic order, then we have to make it very clear that that’s not acceptable”.
“Nobody wanted to be in this position,” said Martin, who stated that every effort was made to deal with any security issues Russia might have. “These issues without question could have been resolved.”
Militarily neutral
Speaking during Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil today, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “Ireland is militarily neutral, but in this conflict, Ireland is not neutral at all.”
“Our support for Ukraine is unwavering,” he said.
“This is an act of aggression. It is unprecedented in the 21st century,” said Varadkar.
“I want to be very clear that the Irish government will fully support any additional sanctions against Russia.”
These include sanctions of a financial nature in relation to banking and financial services, aviation and any other matters, he added.
Varadkar said: “Ireland will not be putting any selfish or economic interests ahead of responses required. We will support whatever sanctions are necessary, including those that would disrupt banking and financial services that are used by Russians… it applies to aviation as well.”
In relation to the Russian ambassador and diplomats, any actions will be taken on a European level.
“So it’s really important that we act in concert with our European allies. But let me be very clear when it comes to accepting refugees, when it comes to financial and other sanctions, Ireland is willing to be at the forefront of doing what is right in that regard, regardless of any selfish or economic concerns we may have for ourselves,” said Varadkar.
In an interview on RTÉ’sMorning Ireland programmeearlier, Coveney said that Ireland will not take a neutral stance on Russia’s belligerence.
“Ireland is a neutral country, we’re militarily non-aligned, but we are certainly not neutral on an issue like this, when there is blatant aggression happening on the continent of Europe,” he said.
The foreign affairs minister said Russia’s aggression is “an attack on a Europe that we have built together collectively since World War II.”
He promised “very direct and very hard-hitting” sanctions against Russia.

He said the costs this year would be met by using money set aside for Covid, but that “into 2023, there will be costs. And therefore the budget towards the latter part of the year will have to reflect that and that does create challenges, economically and fiscally.”
“The economic implications of this war are there to be seen in the continuing increase in energy prices, in food security issues and we know that some sectors of agriculture are bearing the brunt of this,” Mr Martin told reporters in Dublin on Wednesday.
Mr Martin said there was strong political agreement on supporting the welcome for Ukrainian refugees. The war, he said, “is having a terrible traumatic effect on people”.
He said many people had “left their husbands and partners, left their grandparents, to provide safety for their children”.
After meeting the media at an event in the Royal College of Physicians, Mr Martin was approached by a Ukrainian woman who became emotional as she thanked him for all he and Ireland were doing for her country.
The Taoiseach added that refugees arriving from Ukraine would be given the opportunity to get a Covid vaccine. ""We do know that the take-up of vaccines was low in eastern European countries ... but we're confident that with a targeted approach we can increase the levels of vaccination,"" he said.
Mr Martin declined to be drawn on the circumstances surrounding the expulsion of four Russian diplomats this week.
He said that the “activities of these individuals were not in accordance with international standards of diplomacy”.
“I think people can read various things from that, but fundamentally there was a security premise underlining the decision.”
He said they would leave Ireland “within days” but that they would be given time to prepare to depart.
Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said Ireland would potentially have to deliver up to 7,000 extra new homes per year to ensure there would be housing over the next five years for refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.
He said his department estimated that 35,000 additional homes over and above those planned for in the Government’s Housing for All plan may need to be delivered over the five or six years. He said delivering them would require extra funding and the possible use of emergency planning.
Earlier, Minister of State for Europe Thomas Byrne told an Oireachtas committee the Russian embassy had been ""clearly on the radar"" of the State for some time, pointing to the introduction of legislation that prevented the expansion of the embassy and the expulsion of a diplomat following the Salisbury poisonings in 2018.
“The four who have been expelled are not doing the work of diplomacy, they are doing other work,” he said.
Asked about repercussions for Ireland, he said that there would be no grounds for expulsion of Irish diplomats who “are not doing anything that’s incompatible with their diplomatic status”.
""We do not have spies or anyone doing non-diplomatic work in Russia, "" he said. ""However, we all know the form of Russia on this.""

,Taoiseach says Putin an ‘evil dictator’ committing ‘shocking war crimes’,"The Taoiseach has described Russian president Vladimir Putin as an “evil dictator” who is committing “shocking war crimes” in Ukraine. Micheál Martin made the remarks at Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday, where he also said there will be “no hiding place” for Russian oligarch’s money in Ireland.

Micheál Martin made the remarks at Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday, where he also said there will be “no hiding place” for Russian oligarch’s money in Ireland.
Fianna Fáil TDs and Senators were addressed by Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland Larysa Gerasko and her embassy’s charge d’affairs Olena Shaloput.
Ms Gerasko spoke of the impact of the Russian invasion on her country and the loss of life among civilians.
Mr Martin outlined the importance of a common European response to the “barbaric attack” on Ukraine. He said Ireland has advocated for the “widest sanctions possible”.
The Taoiseach outlined how a Cabinet sub-committee of Ministers is scheduled to meet on Thursday to co-ordinate on the humanitarian response to the crisis.
He said that at European Union level Ireland will “ fully support” proposals to ensure that Ukrainian refugees have the right to live, work, access education and healthcare in the EU, initially for one year but also for up to three years.
Mr Martin told the meeting that Europe must show resilience as it faces the consequences of the actions of Mr Putin who he described as an “evil dictator”. He said Mr Putin is “committing shocking war crimes on Ukrainian people.”
Sources said the Ukrainian delegation mentioned the Russian-owned Aughinish Alumina plant in Co Limerick - which has not been included in sanctions - as part of their long contribution.
Mr Martin is said to have spoken in general terms on the need for sanctions to hit Russia and its economy and a source said there was no detailed discussion on the matter at the meeting.
At Fine Gael’s parliamentary party meeting, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the Russian invasion has “changed our world”. He said Ukrainians were “fighting for their independence, democracy, personal liberties and were an inspiration to all”.
He warned the war could become even more violent and difficult in weeks to come and the meeting was told that Russian diplomatic expulsions from Dublin are being considered.
Mr Varadkar said he understood calls for the ambassador’s expulsion but cautioned this could result in the Irish embassy in Moscow being closed to the detriment of 60 Irish students and hundreds of Irish citizens in the country.
Separately, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that 156,000 passport applications were made in February - 20,000 more than January.
Of those, 70,000 applications did not have correct supporting documentation. Another 72,000 were adult renewals with turnarounds achieved within 48 hours for 35,000.
Mr Coveney said processing times were coming down but it was still not where it needed to be.

News of the proposed dialogue had been announced earlier on Sunday after a dispute over the any meeting might take place had been resolved.
“We would welcome such talks because in our view the war, the violence is unjustifiable. We know hospitals are being attacked, schools are being attacked, nurseries and civilians are being killed. It is unacceptable. It is immoral what is going on and it needs to be brought to an end,” said Micheál Martin in Cork on Sunday.
The said the economic impact of the invasion in Europe and across the globe will be significant in terms of energy prices and that the Government would consider how best to deal with the consequences. “The world has changed by virtue of this unjustified war.”
He insisted, however, that the collective response between the European Union, the United States, Canada and others has been “ very telling” and would help to ensure that the various sanctions to be imposed will have the desired impact.
“It does give us the capacity to undermine the industrial base of Russia and its capacity ultimately to wage war. Not in the immediate sense. But certainly will give Russia and many people within Russian leadership in the commercial world pause for thought in terms of their capacity economically and financially to operate with such unprecedented sanctions.”
Mr Martin stressed that a decision by President Putin to put Russia’s nuclear defence forces on high alert was “absolutely irresponsible and reckless”.
He expressed his admiration for the “courage” of the Ukrainian people in seeking to defend their homeland.
“It is quite extraordinary in terms of standing up for its country and their people. But it is at huge cost. This is a further threat but the response has to be firm from the west in terms of the sanctions we have employed. Fundamentally this is about upholding universal principles of self determination, democracy, freedom of speech free media. That is what this is about.”
The Taoiseach added that Ireland plans to do everything in its power to help persons impacted by the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Ukraine.
“We will see what we can do logistically in terms of supplying medical supplies, in terms of providing additional supports with other countries within the European Union in terms of dealing with victims with injuries and so on. Whether our personnel can be deployed on the ground. We will do everything we possibly can to help Ukrainian citizens who have been injured. I think it is shocking what we are witnessing on our television screens.
He said that “nothing is ruled out” in terms of the possible expulsion of the Russian Ambassador or other diplomats from Ireland.
However Mr Martin said it would be preferable if such a measure is to be taken that it would involve a collective decision of EU member States rather than individual decisions by countries.
He stated in respect of the diplomatic situation regarding embassies “unity is strength” and we have to consider the impact of our actions on such matters.
“We should work on a co-ordinated basis with our fellow colleagues across Europe. It is very hard to predict how this crisis is going to unfold.”

However, speaking in the Dáil on Wednesday, Mr Martin said: ""There is no ban on the use of turf in rural Ireland and there will be no ban for the remainder of the year.""
The Taoiseach was responding to Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who said Mr Martin had indicated he would vote against her party’s motion later on Wednesday calling for the ban on the sale of turf from September to be scrapped.
Ms McDonald said this was despite frustration being felt right across rural communities and “despite the fact you couldn’t even convince your own back benchers of the merits of this plan”.
“This plan is the wrong move at the wrong time,” she added. “It’s unfair, it alienates communities and it will be unworkable.”
Mr Martin said the only way the Government could implement the motion was to get rid of legislation that underpins the carbon tax.
There will also be a vote on Wednesday night on a motion tabled by the Rural Independents to remove the carbon tax.
Speaking earlier, Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae said Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had “lost rural Ireland”.
“No matter what twisting and turning you do tonight with the Sinn Féin motion which will be voted on and no matter what amendments and messing around with it you do ... let the message go out from the floor of Dáil Éireann that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have lost rural Ireland in a way you will never get it back and never be trusted again,” he said.

"Harry McGee, Conor Gallagher",Taoiseach condemns ‘sinister’ Russian TV report showing nuclear attack on Ireland,"‘I think it reflects a mindset that is worrying and not in touch with reality,’ Micheál Martin says",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-condemns-sinister-russian-tv-report-showing-nuclear-attack-on-ireland-1.4868521?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-05-03T17:17:55+00:00,"The Taoiseach has condemned a broadcast on Russian state television which showed a mock nuclear attack destroying Ireland, saying it was a ""very sinister, intimidatory-type tactic by the Russian Federation"".
Reacting to the segment on the Russia-1 channel, Micheál Martin said the broadcaster and the Russian authorities should apologise for the broadcast.
""It is very sinister, intimidatory-type tactics by the Russian Federation and I don't think anybody is going to be intimidated by it,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I think it reflects a mindset that is worrying and not in touch with reality.""

Speaking to reporters at Dublin Castle ahead of a Cabinet meeting, Mr Martin said: “I think there should be an apology forthcoming in relation to that.”
He said the more fundamental point he wished to make was that Russia should cease hostilities in Ukraine immediately.
“The degree of bombardment and destruction of towns and cities, and the human carnage that is taking place, is absolutely without justification,” he said. “It is an immoral war and should end.”
The Taoiseach said what was needed now was humanitarian assistance and for people to be allowed safe passage from besieged cities such as Mariupol.
He said a proper humanitarian response was now needed under the auspices of the United Nations.
The Russian Embassy responded to Mr Martin’s remarks about the broadcast with a statement reiterating its stance that “the views and presentations in the TV show are that of the editors”. It said Russia’s official position is “that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and that it must never be unleashed”.
Earlier, Fianna Fáil MEP for Ireland South Billy Kelleher said the Government should summon Russia's ambassador to the State, Yury Filatov, to inform him about ""our absolute disgust about the broadcast"".
A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman gave no indication that this would happen when asked if any diplomatic response was being planned.
“There can be no justification for threatening use of nuclear weapons. Ireland has long argued that nuclear weapons offer no security, and their use would result in devastating humanitarian consequences,” he said.
The spokesman added that Russia was included in statement issued in January by the heads of the five Nuclear Weapon States saying that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.
The Russian state television broadcast included mocked-up clips of nuclear weapons destroying Ireland in response to the UK’s support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war.
The clips were introduced by Dmitry Kiselyov, a close associate of Russian president Vladimir Putin who is perceived as a propagandist for the Kremlin. Russia-1 is the most widely watched television channel in Russia.
Ireland is not mentioned directly in either of the two clips. In one segment, Mr Kiselyov speaks of an attack on the “British Isles” as footage plays of the islands of Ireland and Britain being wiped off the map by a nuclear weapon.
“It actually seems like they’re raving on the British Isles,” Mr Kiselyov says, after baselessly claiming British prime minister Boris Johnson had threatened a nuclear strike on Russia.
“Why threaten neverending Russia when you’re on an island which is, you know, is so small?” he says, according to a translation from journalist Francis Scarr, who monitors Russian media for the BBC.
“The island is so small that just one Sarmat missile is sufficient to sink it once and for all. Everything has been calculated already,” he claims, as a graphic shows a blast erasing Ireland and Britain from the map.
Meanwhile, it was announced on Tuesday that Ireland is to support the creation of a European depository for evidence of war crimes in Ukraine
The European Commission has proposed that Eurojust - the agency responsible for criminal justice co-operation - will collect and preserve evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine including genocide and crimes against humanity.
Under the plans, Eurojust would make the evidence available to national and international judicial authorities.
Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said she would bring motions before the Dáil and Seanad this week seeking Oireachtas backing for Ireland’s support of the European initiative.

“Russia's brutal war against this beautiful democratic country is a gross violation of international law.
""It is an affront to everything that Ireland stands for, it cannot and it will not be allowed to stand.”
Martin said that earlier in the day, he witnessed “firsthand the horrific reality of war on the people of Ukraine” and that he met with local representatives who shared “with great detail” about the atrocities that had occurred.
“The use of terror against and the deliberate targeting of civilian populations are war crimes,” Martin said. “Those responsible, those carrying out these actions, and those directing them will be held fully accountable, and there will be no hiding places. That is why we’re delivering additional funding to the International Criminal Court.”

Mr Martin is in the Ukrainian capital where he held talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The leaders met in Mr Zelensky’s heavily fortified offices in the city to discuss the war and Irish and EU efforts to support Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.
In a speech in Kyiv on Wednesday, Mr Martin said he wished to express Ireland’s solidarity with the people of Ukraine.
“We admire you and we are with you.  Russia’s brutal war against this beautiful, democratic country is a gross violation of international law.  It is an affront to everything that Ireland stands for.  It cannot and it will not be allowed to stand,” Mr Martin said.
The Taoiseach paid tribute to President Zelenskiy on achieving EU candidate status, saying “Ukraine belongs to the European Union” and that Ireland would “be with you every step of the way and we’ll do what we can to help”.
Prior to the talks with the Ukrainian president, Mr Martin visited a museum in Kyiv that is exhibiting items from the war, including damaged Russian military vehicles and missile fragments.
He placed a teddy bear at a nearby memorial to the children killed in the conflict so far.
Mr Martin then visited a memorial commemorating the lives lost in the Holodomor famine in Ukraine in the early 1930s.
The Taoiseach placed a wreath at the site and later lit a candle in an underground part of the memorial.
He began a trip to Kyiv by viewing the conflict-scarred suburbs of Borodyanka, Bucha and Irpin.
The tour included a sombre visit to the site of a mass grave in the grounds of a church in Bucha.
Mr Martin is using the visit to Kyiv to reiterate Ireland’s solidarity with the Ukrainian authorities in the face of the Russian invasion.
His day-long itinerary in the war-torn city began with a trip to Borodyanka – a town on the outskirts of Kyiv that has suffered widespread damage under Russian shelling.
On the 30-minute drive from the railway station, the Taoiseach passed Hostomel airport, where his convoy stopped to observe a demolished bridge.
The delegation also drove past bombed-out warehouses, shopping centres and petrol stations.
The scale of Ukrainian efforts to defend their capital was evident, with numerous bunkers and fortifications visible on the journey.
In Borodyanka, Mr Martin met the town’s mayor and viewed apartment blocks gutted by fire during the Russian bombardment.
From there, Mr Martin visited the site of a mass grave in Bucha. The grave was discovered in the grounds of the church of St Andrew.
A local cleric showed Mr Martin the site and an associated exhibition of graphic photographs of exhumed bodies and pictures of civilians left dead on the streets of the suburb when Russian forces retreated.
The Irish delegation then travelled to nearby Irpin where the Taoiseach was shown badly-damaged apartment blocks that had been hit by Russian shells.
Afterwards, Mr Martin said: “It is difficult to comprehend the devastation and inhumanity of Russia’s attacks on Irpin, Borodyanka and Bucha.
He said it was “clear how important it is for women and children to get to Ireland to escape trauma and brutality. We stand with Ukraine.”

Mr Martin said Ireland will stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s “immoral and unprovoked war of terror”, in advance of his arrival in Kyiv on Wednesday morning.
He will engage with Ukrainian authorities on how Ireland and the EU can support the country’s current and future needs.
Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr Martin said: “The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes, and I will use my visit to express Ireland’s support for moves to hold those behind these attacks fully accountable.
“The spirit and resolve of the Ukrainian people has inspired us all, and Ireland will provide every support for Ukraine’s path to full EU Membership, and continue to welcome and support civilians fleeing this war.”
[Ukraine calls for evacuation of Donetsk cities before Russian onslaughtOpens in new window]
Mr Martin was invited to Ukraine last month by Mr Zelenskiy, who also singled him out for thanks after the European Council approved Ukraine’s bid for candidate status at a recent summit in Brussels. Mr Martin was a strong early supporter of Ukraine’s bid for membership of the EU.
He will become the latest in a series of western leaders to visit the Ukrainian capital since Russia’s invasion of the country in late February.
It also comes after Mr Putin on Monday declared victory in seizing the eastern Ukrainian province of Luhansk, with his troops escalating their offensive in neighbouring Donetsk.
Mr Martin has warned previously that the Russian president appeared to be leveraging its natural gas supplies to exert maximum pressure on Europe ahead of the winter period.
Ireland has also taken in more than 36,000 Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of the Russian invasion.
The Irish State has given €20 million in humanitarian support and assistance to the country, as well as health equipment and medical donations worth more than €4.5 million.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney visited Kyiv in April and Mr Zelenskiy has also addressed the Oireachtas by video-link, praising the Irish people’s support for his country. – Additional reporting PA

FIANNA FÁIL TD John Lahart has said he does not expect Micheál Martin to lead the party into the next election.
It comes after his party colleagueJohn McGuinness said that Martin should resignas party leader as he steps down from the role of Taoiseach at the end of the year.
McGuinness also said the party should refuse to back Leo Varadkar as Taoiseach if Micheál Martin does not stand down as Fianna Fáil leader.
OnNewstalk Breakfastthis morning, Lahart said:
“The Taoiseach has said he is going to lead the party into the next election and I understand why he has said that.
“If you look at Enda Kenny, he announced one day he was going to cease to be Taoiseach a couple of months ahead of time and literally within an hour, his power as Taoiseach began to evaporate and speculation began as to who was going to succeed him.
“I don’t believe he will lead us into the next General Election. It is not beyond the man actually – he has done it before – to walk into the Dáil and make a dramatic statement.”
Martin, who has led Fianna Fail since 2011, has been the Taoiseach since 2020 but is due to hand the position over to Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar in December as part of the agreements of the coalition government, mid-way through its term.

‘Excellent Taoiseach’
Lahart said that Martin “has been an excellent Taoiseach” and is held in very high regard within the party.
However, he added that there was nothing negative about opening up a conversation ahead of the transition in December when Varadkar will rotate back into the roll as Taoiseach.
The transition “focuses minds – particularly if we don’t think he is going to lead us into the next election”, added Lahart.
He said the party must consider what steps should we take to ensure the party is in the “best shape to face the electorate in 2025″.
Lahart also said that the Programme for Government needs a fresh look, stating that he  was “kind of surprised” to hear both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste rule out any review at the half-way point.
“The Programme for Government was agreed two years ago. I think everybody would agree that if it is to be relevant, it should be a living document with an opportunity to, kind of, breathe new life into it.
“The world has changed dramatically since the Programme for Government was agreed,” he said.
He said no one is talking about a complete renegotiation, but he said it needs updating to deal with the problems facing society today. He added that such a review is not unprecedented and has happened in the past.
Backbench TDs in Fianna Fáil are serious about the review being needed, said Lahart, stating that there are real consequences for Fianna Fáil losing the office of An Taoiseach in December.
“Communications is clearly an issue in terms of Fianna Fáil asserting itself in Government,” he added.

A FIANNA FÁIL TD has said that Micheál Martin should resign as party leader as he steps down from the role of Taoiseach at the end of the year.
John McGuinness, TD for Carlow-Kilkenny, said that some of Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party are becoming “anxious” about how close it is to Fine Gael.
Martin, who has led Fianna Fail since 2011, has been the Taoiseach since 2020 but is due to hand the position over to Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar in December as part of the agreements of the coalition government, mid-way through its term.
Speaking on Newstalk’sOn The Record with Gavan Reillyprogramme, McGuinness said that “we’re looking to the future in terms of the leadership of the party, the next general election and so on, and there’s always a time mid-term to look at these issues and look at the changes that are necessary both in policy and direction”.
“It’s a natural timing that you would look at these things, just as much as you should look at the program for government which was brought about in 2020 under completely different circumstances”.
“A lot of the parliamentary party are now becoming anxious about how close we have become to Fine Gael and how close our policies are with Fine Gael and there’s no distinction between both parties, so the time has come to create that distinction and to follow the policies that we once had,” he said.

“The confidence and supply arrangement, I think, was very damaging for the party.”
McGuinness, the Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, and Taoiseach, said he would oppose current Tánaiste Leo Varadkar becoming Taoiseach if Micheál Martin does not step down as Fianna Fáil’s party leader.
“I would subscribe to that but I would hope it would not come to that,” he said.
“That’s something that I will promote with colleagues at a parliamentary party meeting and accept then the consensus from the meeting in terms of the direction that we will take.”
The unusual coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party decided at its outset that Micheál Martin would take the role of Taoiseach for the first half of its term and it would then go to Leo Varadkar, who was Taoiseach at the time of the general election.
Last week, the governmentwon a confidence votein the Dáil by a margin of 85 to 66 despite losing its majority due to TDs resigning the whip.
Sinn Féin had proposed a vote of no confidence in the government, with leader Mary Lou McDonald saying it was “out of touch” and “coming apart at the seams”.

Picture: Darragh Kane
TAOISEACH Micheál Martin has said he hoped the election of new British prime minister Liz Truss will offer the chance for a critical ""reset"" in Anglo-Irish and Anglo-EU relations.
Mr Martin also confirmed he will be contacting Ms Truss to personally congratulate her and to offer talks and hopefully EU negotiations about the Northern Ireland Protocol.
""I want to congratulate Liz Truss on her election as leader of the Conservative Party and her expected confirmation as British Prime Minister in the coming days,” Mr Martin said.
""I see this as an opportunity to re-set relationships between Great Britain and Ireland post-Brexit and also between the EU and Great Britain.
""At the weekend I had some talks with outgoing ministers of the UK Government and suffice to say there was a general view that we should do everything we possibly can over the coming weeks to break the deadlock on the (NI) Protocol between the EU and the UK.""
""To facilitate progress on that front - that would be my earnest wish. I look forward to engaging with the new Prime Minister in the coming while in a bid to achieve that - to get a process in place.
""It is extremely important that we do that.""
Mr Martin said Ireland will not preempt matters.
""I think we have to wait and see - give the new Prime Minister every opportunity to settle in. But suffice to say, we have to - if we collectively put the people of Northern Ireland at the centre of our attention and focus,” he said.
""If we work to bring about changes in the operation of the Protocol that will facilitate concerns that will be legitimately raised - then I think we will be on the pathway to a resolution.
""That would be the objective of the EU working with the UK Government - to get into a detailed, serious negotiation process to bring out the desired outcome.
""Parallel to that we want to see a restoration of the Executive in Northern Ireland, a restoration of the Assembly to meet and respond to the mandate that the people of Northern Ireland gave to their elected representatives.
""In the current cost of living crisis, hundreds of millions of pounds are available to the NI Executive to spend to alleviate the pressures on people in respect of the energy crisis.
""It will need a restoration of the Executive to facilitate the spending of that money.
""This is not about personalities and issues - it is about serious issues around the relationship between Europe and the UK, the relationship between Ireland and the UK.
""In a post-Brexit world, how do we deal with the unique situation of Northern Ireland in terms of trade?""
""The vast, vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want continued access to the EU Single Market as well of course unfettered access to the UK market. Therein lies opportunity for business in NI.""
""We have heard directly from industry, agriculture and other (NI) interests - they are very clear they feel the Protocol has been beneficial, particularly to manufacturing.""
""Other sectors have had challenges and there is a responsibility and an obligation on all of us to work to remove those challenges.""
Mr Martin said the various personalities in British politics cannot deter from the issues at hand.
""It is not just one person - if we have learned anything about British politics over the last number of years… there was a general election, the Conservative Party won that election quite well,” the Taoiseach said.
""They have views and a particular outlook on certain issues not least it's relationship with Europe.
""Northern Ireland is a factor in that and therefore I would say initially that the spirit in which we are approaching this is a constructive one.
""We do believe it is in the interests of the people in NI that we get these issues resolved.
""We believe they can be resolved. The EU Commission want to resolve this - but it takes both sides to engage.
""We would hope that the UK Government and the EU will be in a position to get into a process.
""There will be contacts in the coming while.
""The Brexit process has been (going on) for quite a number of years now. We have had four British Prime Ministers in that period.
""So that is my point - notwithstanding that we have had three different Prime Ministers since Brexit happened, the individuals can put a particular emphasis and shape on it but the more fundamental issue is the one about the relationship between the UK and EU. That is not personality specific alone.
""There are wider views within the Conservative Party. Obviously the Prime Minister has a key role to play in directly the process - there is an opportunity now there and we are hopeful it will be taken up.""

LAST UPDATE|9 May 2022
THE GOVERNMENT WILL press ahead with plans for the new National Maternity Hospital, with Taoiseach Micheal Martin insisting that fears surrounding its ownership structure have been “comprehensively addressed”.
The relocation to a site on the grounds of St Vincent’s Hospital in Dublin has proved highly controversial as, until recently, the site was owned by the Religious Sisters of Charity.
The religious congregation has now transferred its ownership and if the relocation plan goes ahead the State would lease the land for 299 years.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, the Taoiseach noted that the need for a new maternity hospital has been lost in the debate around ownership. “In my view, the current hospital it’s not acceptable. It’s not fit for purpose for the women of Ireland today.
“The new hospital will be a very significant advance on the current hospital in terms of extra inpatient beds. [There will be] a fantastic new, world-class neonatal unit, with far more cots and individual rooms, which helps the outcomes of newborns, premature newborns from as early as 23 weeks,” he said.
When pressed on concerns surrounding the involvement of religious orders in the hospital, Martin said these had been “comprehensively addressed through the Constitution of the new hospital”.
“The directors of the hospital are obliged to carry out all legal services permissible within the State,” he said. “The new hospital will be more secular in governance than the existing hospital has been in its history.”
Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has said that if the Government were to start the process again, it could add another 10 to 15 years to the project.

Speaking to RTÉ’s News at One, Donnelly said that if a Compulsive Purchase Order (CPO) were to be pursued, there would be no guarantee that it would get through the courts.
“We would need to demonstrate to court that we needed to own the land and I would imagine if it ever got to court, St Vincent’s would say ‘but sure we’ve given them the land for 300 years,” said Donnelly, adding that legal advice he received said it would add years to the project.
“If we were to start again, there’d be no guarantee of co-location, which means less good specialist care for women.
“I think we could well be adding 10 to 15 years to the project and I simply do not believe that we should do that. We’ve been talking about this for long enough, we need to get this hospital built.”
Last week, St Vincent’s Healthcare Group (SVHG) completed the legal transfer of the Sisters of Charity’s shareholding in the group to a new company, St Vincent’s Holdings CLG, paving the way for the maternity hospital to be built on the St Vincent’s site.
But Cabinet has stalled the proposal to allow for documents about ownership and governance arrangements to be published, and to allow Minister Donnelly to appear before the Oireachtas Health Committee this week to address lingering concerns.
Campaigners and opposition political parties have raised a number of concerns about the proposed deal, including the possibility that certain medical procedures such as abortions could not be carried out at the hospital because they are not approved by the Catholic church.
The history of abuse scandals involving religious orders, particularly regarding institutions such as Magdalene Laundries and industrial schools, has led others to say that religious organisations should have no involvement in the provision of women’s healthcare.
The Department of Health has repeatedly stated that all procedures that are currently provided at the National Maternity Hospital under Irish law will be provided in the new NMH if it relocates to the Dublin 4 site.
This includes termination of pregnancy, provision of contraception services including tubal ligation, fertility services and gender reassignment procedures.

The Government is planning to press ahead with plans to locate the National Maternity Hospital at the St Vincent’s Hospital site in Dublin.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that concerns about the ownership agreement over the new hospital have been “comprehensively addressed”.
He told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that in his view, the current hospital was not fit for purpose and that plans for the new hospital were a significant advance.
The proposal to co-locate it at St Vincent’s had been agreed by experts 20 years ago and that part of the debate was being lost, he said.
Fears over ownership had been comprehensively addressed through the constitution of the new hospital, which would be obliged to carry out all procedures legal in the State.
The new hospital will be “more secular” than the current hospital which was already carrying out all these procedures and the Minister for Health would also have the power to instruct the hospital to provide such services, he added.

Michael O'Dowd,Time is ticking for the Taoiseach,"Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the power is beginning to seep away from current Taoiseach Micheál Martin as the date for his handover of power to Tanaiste Leo Varadkar approaches the six-month mark.",https://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/time-ticking-for-taoiseach,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-06-10T09:05:30+00:00,"While Micheál Martin is not yet in lame-duck territory, at some point, possibly over the summer recess, such a tipping point will be reached and the focus will shift from his current plans to those of his successor.
It's worth looking once again at the terms of the deal for government that wasput together in June 2020which saw traditional bitter rivals Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael share power with the support of the Green Party. It states inter alia that the “leader of Fianna Fáil will hold the office of an taoiseach until December 15, 2022, on which date he will offer his resignation to the president and all parties and TDs supporting the government will support the nomination of the leader of the Fine Gael party.”

While Martin’s term as taoiseach got off to a bumpy start, he has had a successful past 12 months as the country rapidly recovered economically from Covid. For instance, latest employment figures showover 2.5 million in workduring the first quarter of the year, a number that exceeds pre-pandemic levels. Martin has also held the lineon Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol.
However, storm clouds are beginning to gather. First off is the reopening of discussion and dissent within his own party.
Barry Cowen, a former minister for agriculture who was sacked by Martin after just 17 days in office over a drunk driving row, tabled a motion at an internal Fianna Fáil meeting questioning the performance of the party in government and saying it has been sidelined by Sinn Féin. It is a shot across the bow from Cowen, who has long contended that Fianna Fáil should have a new leader before the next election.
There is no immediate danger to Martin. For the next six months, he holds all the cards as a government reshuffle will follow a change in taoiseach and he retains the power to promote backbench TDs to ministerial jobs.
Cowen will bide his time and likely strike again in the new year. He will not be alone at that juncture as hell hath no fury like a disappointed TD, and there will be plenty by then.
Indeed, that reshuffle poses a dilemma for Martin as to which position he will take. The obvious one is foreign affairs, a job he previously held, as that will ensure he remains at the center of discussions on Northern Ireland.
He certainly will not want to have Fine Gael controlling the policy on the North which they would do if they held the office of taoiseach and minister for foreign affairs. The ghosts of Fianna Fáil would rise up against that regardless of the present détente between the parties. Current Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, lauded by nationalists for his stewardship on the northern question, may be the loser in that particular power play.

Some old unfinished problems are also returning. Housing and homelessness are once again beginning to chip away at confidence in the competence of this government. As the man in power, Martin is taking a hit.
The other indication of a shift in the balance of power is recent statements by his presumptive successor Varadkar, who has returned to a theme he previously promoted: Fine Gael being the party that looks after those who “rise early,” code for the economically stretched middle classes.
In an implied criticism of current government direction, he stated he wanted his period as taoiseach, or as he put it “the second half of government,” to commit to significantly reducing the cost of living for working families and middle-income families in Ireland. The fact that he hasn’t delivered on his previous commitments in relation to this cohort despite being at the very center of government since 2017 doesn’t appear to bother him.
4Leo Varadkar. (RollingNews.ie)
Leo Varadkar. (RollingNews.ie)
While Varadkar has been somewhat restrained in his public pronouncements to date, there are reports of his inner circle beginning to flex their muscles in anticipation of a return to power. Where this is having effect is among the civil servants who pull the levers of power. They are more adept than most in sensing the prevailing winds, and they certainly are blowing in Varadkar’s direction.
However, Varadkar shouldn’t be counting the chickens just yet. Gardaíinvestigating the leak of a confidential contract by Varadkarto a friend have concluded their investigations, and a decision as to whether a prosecution will follow is awaited. If he is prosecuted, it will make it difficult for him to assume the position of leader of the country.
Being Ireland, this decision is taking an interminably long time, but most commentators believe that Varadkar as a senior politician with influence will not have to face a court case. Again, this is Ireland after all.
The changeover of taoiseach will have its own challenges. Disgruntled TDs in other parties will seek to cause difficulties.
The Green Party, which also signed up to government, suspended two of its TDs recently overa vote on the National Maternity Hospital. A situation that has led to the government having a majority of only one at present in the Dáil. Their readmission will be discussed just prior to the changeover.
Will that party try to renegotiate the program for government, and will their membership support any new arrangement?
What is concentrating all minds are the opinion polls which show Sinn Féin with an enormous lead which, depending on the polling company, has them either practically level or just ahead of the combined total support of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.
The old truism surely applies to those two parties – if they don’t hang together, they’ll hang separately. Ireland’s political landscape is being reshaped before our eyes.
So where does this leave Martin? Well, he’s still in the driving seat and no doubt would like a significant win before his term is up.
The success of Irish taoisigh is by and large defined by how they perform in relation toNorthern Ireland. Amoribund Northern Assembly, an intractable dispute with the UKover the Brexit Protocol, and aresurgent Sinn Féindo not look well on the list of achievements for Martin.
Added to that is hisreluctance to contemplate a border poll, allowing Fine Gael to raise the issue first within government. It’s hard to see how he can turn this around. The clock is ticking and the likelihood is that his term will end with a whimper rather than a bang.

LAST UPDATE|8 Jun 2022
BRITISH LABOUR LEADER Keir Starmer has arrived in Dublin ahead of his meetings with political leaders tomorrow, where ongoing tensions between the EU and UK over the Northern Ireland Protocol are expected to dominate discussions.
Starmer will hold talks with Taoiseach Micheál Martin tomorrow, and will also meet with President Michael D Higgins at 11:30am in Áras an Uachtaráin.
Meetings have also been scheduled with Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney and Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, as well as with Labour leader Ivana Bacik.
The trip is his first visit to Ireland as Labour leader.
The British Irish Chamber of Commerce this evening hosted Starmer for an event with representatives from businesses across the island of Ireland.
The ‘Business Leader Engagement with Keir Starmer’ event saw the British Labour leader discuss business ties between the UK and Ireland and the need for the UK and EU to reach an agreement on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Chamber briefed the UK’s Leader of the Opposition on the impact of trade disruptions on a variety of industries ranging from agri-food and ICT to the higher education and research.
“We’re delighted to welcome the Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer to Dublin, where he spent an evening with Irish businesses leaders, representing companies that employ over 120,000 people in the UK,” Director-General of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce John McGrane said this evening.
He said Starmer’s visit is “extremely timely and important” given the need for all sides to work together and find “pragmatic solutions” to the Protocol, adding that it’s “vital” that politics does not get in the way.
“With businesses facing rapidly rising prices and an uncertain economic outlook, businesses need above all to have clarity and certainty over the trading arrangements between these islands,” McGrane said.
“In gaining agreement on the Northern Ireland Protocol, firms on both sides of the Irish Sea can get on with trade and realise the potential of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
“The Chamber remains committed to this dialogue and we will continue to work with UK, Irish and EU leaders from across the political spectrum.”
Time for ‘practical solutions’
Starmer said the Chamber plays a vital role in “maintaining focus on the value of two-way trade between the United Kingdom and Ireland, for business, for our governments, and our communities”.
“Business always finds a way forward with determination and optimism, working together in the spirit of finding collective solutions. You do it because people need you to. Politicians need to find a similar way forward, to secure certainty and clarity for British and Irish trade,” he said.
Starmer will head to Belfast on Friday to meet political leaders in Stormont, where he is expected to call for compromise and negotiation to end the political deadlock over the return of the power-sharing Executive.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said the UK intends to legislate to override parts of the deal on Northern Ireland, with the details expected to be announced in the coming week.
Opposition to that deal has seen the DUP block efforts to restore power-sharing in the region.
In anaddressto the European Parliament today, the Taoiseach said Britain’s plans to act unilaterally over the Northern Ireland Protocol would be “deeply damaging” and mark a “historic low point”.
Martin said the UK Government’s proposed legislation to override key parts of the Brexit deal would be “to the benefit of absolutely no-one”.
He also said during his visit to Strasbourg that he disagrees with the UK Government’s handling of the protocol and accused it of failing to engage with the EU.
“I have said many times that there are solutions to practical problems under the protocol if there is a political will to find them. But that requires partnership. It requires the UK Government to engage with good faith, seriousness, and commitment,” he said.
“I disagree with the approach that the United Kingdom Government has taken in respect of dealing with the protocol and its failure really to engage and to engage in a substantive way with the European Union, and particularly the Commission and Maros Sefcovic,” he added.
Boris Johnson
Following his remarks, Boris Johnson denied the UK Government has failed to consult one of its senior legal advisers over plans to unilaterally scrap elements of Brexit’s Northern Ireland Protocol.
The British Prime Minister rejected the claim that First Treasury Counsel James Eadie, the Government’s independent barrister on major legal issues, had not been asked to give a view on the contentious Bill due to be tabled at Westminster.
Sky News reported that Eadie has not been consulted on whether the legislation would breach international law.
SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood challenged Johnson on the report during Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons.
“I can tell him that the reports that he has seen this morning are not correct,” replied Johnson.
“And what I can also tell him is that the most important commitment that I think everybody in this House has made is to the balance and symmetry of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.
“That is our highest legal international priority and that is what we must deliver.”
Downing Street said a “number of legal experts” had been involved in the legislation, which has yet to be finalised.

"Pat Leahy, Freya McClements, Simon Carswell","UK has moved ‘too far’ unilaterally over Northern Ireland protocol, Taoiseach says",Micheál Martin in Belfast for talks aimed at breaking political deadlock in North,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/uk-has-moved-too-far-unilaterally-over-northern-ireland-protocol-taoiseach-says-1.4883730?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-05-20T08:52:36+00:00,"The Taoiseach has said there is ""no substitute"" for ""substantive, serious negotiations"" between the EU and the UK to resolve issues around the Northern Ireland protocol.
Micheál Martin also called for the restoration of the North’s power-sharing institutions and said there should be “parallel discussions” which would allow the restoration of a functioning Assembly and Executive while negotiations on the protocol continued between the EU and the UK.
Speaking to reporters in Belfast on Friday following meetings with political and business leaders, he was also deeply critical of legislation introduced by the UK government this week to deal with the legacy of the Troubles which will offer a conditional amnesty to perpetrators deemed to have co-operated with a new information recovery body and said he was ""fundamentally very much opposed"" to the proposals.
The proposed legislation created ""essentially the guts of an amnesty for people who committed terrible crimes, irrespective of whether they were security forces or members of various paramilitary groups who committed terrible crimes"" and ""for many of those paramilitary groups, this is literally a get-out-of-jail legislation from any further investigation"", Mr Martin said.
“It’s a plan that needs significant examination, the full implications I don’t believe are fully understood by many involved,” he added.
“It’s a unilateral measure again and I have concerns about the unilateral strain within the current British government towards aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.”
The North remains without a functioning Assembly or Executive after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) blocked the appointment of a speaker following this month's Assembly elections as part of its protest against the Northern Ireland protocol.
In a further sign that there will be no swift remedy to the deadlock, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson reiterated his call to see the detail of proposed legislation announced by the UK to unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol before making a decision on whether it would re-enter Stormont.
Speaking after his party’s meeting with the Taoiseach on Friday, Mr Donaldson said: “We are not interested in a sticking plaster approach, or tinkering around the edges, it has to be fundamental change which respects Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market and nothing short of that will suffice.”
Mr Martin said he believed the issues around the protocol could be resolved but said the UK government kept moving the goalposts regarding its position.
“On the UK Government side, we haven’t quite got a clear landing zone. The goalposts do keep moving in that respect,” Mr Martin said.
“What was produced this week by the UK Government again indicates a widening of the picture in respect of resolving the issues of the protocol.”
He said the EU “wants to resolve this” and wanted to engage in “meaningful negotiations” with the UK government and did not accept the proposition that the EU had not been flexible.
Mr Martin was speaking as the British ambassador to Ireland Paul Johnston justified his government's stance on the basis that ""times have changed"" since the protocol was agreed was in 2019. The protocol is part of part of the EU-UK Brexit deal to allows goods to pass freely between Northern Ireland in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in the EU.
Mr Johnston told reporters in Dublin: “The world itself has changed in the intervening period. We now face a cost of living crisis, we’ve had Covid, we’ve had a lot of factors which are relevant but which weren’t there at the time,” he said
“I think although you hear from the Commission ‘pacta sunt servanda’ – agreements need to be respected – I think there’s also a case of ‘tempora mutantur’ – the times change and we change with them.”
During his visit to Belfast on Friday, the Taoiseach met the leaders of Sinn Féin, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP, and spoke virtually with the Alliance leader on Thursday. He also met members of the Northern Ireland Business Brexit Working Group.
The Taoiseach said all parties had “indicated a desire to have the Assembly back up and running” and had said they were “willing to abide by the result” of the election.
The DUP, he said, “were clear that they have no difficulty in taking up the Deputy First Minister position but they have issues with the protocol.”
Mr Donaldson said his party had “spelled it out very clearly to him the problems with the protocol, the harm it is doing to Northern Ireland and that we need a solution, we need decisive action to deal with these problems.”
Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill accused the DUP of “denying democracy” and said “there are parties here that want to be in Government together, there are parties that want to be in the executive but, unfortunately, the DUP, sponsored by the British government, are holding back all of that progress and preventing us from being able to start to put money in people’s pockets.”
Earlier on Friday morning Mr Martin said the UK government had moved “too far in a unilateral way” over its approach to the Northern Ireland protocol, which was not in accordance with the spirit of the Belfast Agreement.
He told the BBC: ""I spoke to Boris Johnson and I have to nail this, this idea that somehow the European Union is being inflexible on this is just not the truth, it doesn't stack up.""
Mr Martin added there cannot be a situation where one political party is refusing to allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet, saying it is ""unheard of in a democratic world"".
On the protocol, the Taoiseach said: “What has happened now is a certain unilateralism on behalf of the British government saying ‘our way or no way’ and you don’t negotiate with the European Union on that basis, particularly when you have signed off on the agreement that you now don’t like.
""Professional, serious negotiations between the United Kingdom government and the European Union is the only way to resolve this.""
Speaking after his meeting with Mr Martin, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said he proposed a “landing zone” solution to the Taoiseach over issues with the protocol.
Mr Beattie said: “There is no requirement on checks on goods that come from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland. If they are going on to the EU single market then they can be checked, and all we need to do is make sure that the scaffolding and the architecture is put in place to make sure that that can happen.
“That is the landing zone and we believe that landing zone will get people back into government. We asked the Taoiseach to make representations to the European Union to that effect.”

Barry Roche,Taoiseach tells HSE system must change to ensure ‘rapid delivery’ of aids for children with disabilities,Families call on Micheál Martin to act on ‘collapse of children’s disability services with urgency’,https://www.irishtimes.com/health/2022/06/20/taoiseach-tells-hse-system-must-change-to-ensure-rapid-delivery-of-aids-for-children-with-disabilities/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-06-20T20:49:33+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told the HSE that there should be no delays in providing equipment to the families of children with disabilities amid reports of people waiting months and sometimes years for aids like wheelchairs, leg braces and bath supports.
Mr Martin said he told the HSE “the system needs to change in terms of more rapid delivery of aids” after a campaign by Cork-based Families Unite for Services and Support (FUSS) highlighted the struggles to him.
Rachel Martin of FUSS was one of 50 people who protested outside Cork City Hall last week for better services for children with disabilities, and handed Mr Martin a letter detailing some of the challenges facing more than 30 families from Mr Martin’s own Cork South Central constituency.
Among the cases FUSS highlighted in the letter was the case of a 20-month-old girl who has a rare neurological condition and is waiting for months on a buggy, stander and sleeping aid and is also waiting on speech and language therapy.
Another child has been waiting six months for a bath support, while another child has been waiting nine months for leg braces. Another child has been waiting two years for a new wheelchair and is forced to use a wheelchair that she had clearly outgrown, said Ms Martin.
Other children have been waiting three and four years for both occupational therapy and speech and language therapy while a little boy with intellectual disability issues is now three years old and waiting assessment even though he is engaging in serious escalating incidents of self-harm.
Mr Martin said he had convened a meeting two weeks ago between the HSE and the Department of Education to examine what was required in terms of establishing schools for children with special needs and some progress had been made.
“On the education front, we did start a new school in Carrigaline last year – we have acquired land in Glanmire in respect of a new special school and further educational development – there will be further investments in SNAs [special needs assistants],” he said.
“Then in terms of the healthcare settings, we want the special schools to be ring-fenced in respect of the therapies – the therapies would be restored to special school over time because under progressing disability, it is administered by the HSE,” he said.
Mr Martin also said the Government would provide funding to enable the HSE to recruit specialist occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, as well as personnel to carry out assessment on the needs of children with autism and other intellectual disabilities.
Handing Mr Martin the letter of complaint, Ms Martin said: “We call on you as our Taoiseach, our local representative, a citizen of this country and our neighbour, to act on the collapse of children’s disability services with the urgency it so desperately requires.
“We watch as Ministers ask for access to the services they are supposed to have control of and see how little power they have when they are stonewalled with fake data or just denied access altogether.
“Meanwhile our children lose a little bit more every day, a little bit more mobility, a few more skills and a hell of a lot more dignity. Because there is no two ways about it, it’s degrading having to make our personal struggles public like this again and again. Our children deserve dignity and privacy.”

TAOISEACH MICHEAL MARTIN has insisted that the government cannot spend unlimited resources on the cost of living crisis, in the face of growing calls for an emergency budget.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put the issue to the Taoiseach at Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil today, saying “households cannot wait” until the budget in October for more help making ends meet.
She criticised Martin’s argument that the government had to protect the economy, saying: “Above all else we need to protect our people.”
“You are asking people to wait … I am appealing to you to change that position.”
Martin said that McDonald and her party didn’t “get the enterprise side of the economy, or want to.
“We can’t take risks with the economy or with inflation,” he said. “The idea of protecting jobs is something you should pay more attention to.”
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy similarly urged Martin to initiate a mini budget.
“I’m really struggling to understand why you’re refusing to alleviate the pressure,” she said.
“All we’ve got is platitudes … people are worried about how they’re going to heat their homes, pay their mortgage.

“Four months feels like a lifetime,” she said, adding that the economic forecast indicates that the spiralling cost of living “is going to worsen” in the coming months.
Martin retorted that those calling for a mini budget were actually looking for a “mini expenditure”.
“A budget has pluses and minuses.”
Richard O’Donoghue of the Rural Independents blasted the government for “robbing the people of this country” by taking 49% of the cost of petrol in tax.
He took issue with Martin characterising the rapid rise of fuel prices as the “energy strategy” of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Fuel in Malta, he said, was considerably lower than in Ireland, at €1.21 per litre for diesel and €1.36 per litre for petrol.
Martin responded by saying that Malta has one of the highest borrowing rates in the EU.
Energy rationing may “be a reality” due to reduced gas supplies from Russia being delivered in the coming months, EU CommissionerMairead McGuinnesssaid today.
Russian gas supplies to European countries like Germany and Italy have been reduced in recent days, while earlier this year gas supplies were cut to bothPoland and Bulgaria.
Speaking in Brussels this afternoon, McGuinness, the Commissioner for financial services, warned that while the European Commission will try to avoid any kind of fuel and energy rationing, such measures may be necessary.#
This morning, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrathurged peopleto contact the Department of Social Protection if they are struggling to pay bills.
However, like Martin, he has said that it’s not possible for the government to “offset every increase that people are experiencing at this time”.

UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR Zelenskyy has invited Taoiseach Micheál Martin to visit Ukraine.
The two leaders spoke ahead of a European Council meeting on Thursday and Friday where EU leaders are due to discuss the European Commission’s recommendation to grant Ukraine candidacy status.
Martin said he was “delighted” to speak with Zelenskyy and confirm Ireland’s support for Ukraine’s EU membership.

“We are, and will be, with Ukraine every step of the way,” he said.
The Taoiseach has advocated for fast-tracked membership of the EU for Ukraine and has used Ireland as an example of how a country can develop through EU membership.
Zelenskyy thanked Ireland for its “active support of Ukraine’s European aspirations” and the status of a candidate for EU membership.
He added that he invited Martin “to make the first visit to Ukraine in the history of bilateral relations.”
Zelenskyy has spoken to several EU leaders today ahead of the summit – including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who he also invited to visit Ukraine.
Ukraine is in the early stages of applying to join the EU after requesting to apply for membership a week after Russia invaded the country.
The European Commission delivered its proposal to award Ukraine candidate status after a fast-tracked analysis of answers to an EU-membership questionnaire.
Despite the European Commission’s endorsement, it is likely to take years or even decades to lead to EU membership for Ukraine.
Martin said previously that the process to apply to join the EU is “complex and challenging”.
“It requires considerable work on the part of the country looking to join.
“Ireland is ready to walk every step of that journey with Ukraine, providing whatever support and encouragement we can along the way.”

Mr Martin said he intends to meet with CHI, which governs the children's hospitals in Dublin, and the HSE in relation to waiting times for children who require urgent surgery.
Mr Martin was responding to Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald during Leaders' Questions in the Dáil on Wednesday, who raised the case of Ava Cahill (11) who is waiting to receive corrective surgery to address spina bifida for more than a year and a half.
Ms McDonald said 90,000 children are on some form of waiting list and many with spina bifida wait between one and four years for orthopedic surgery and called for funding to be released immediately.
“Funding is not an excuse any longer,” Mr Martin said. “Record sums of money have been given to the health service executive, the CHI ,they should get on with it and get it done.”
He said it was “not acceptable” for children to wait so long for urgent surgery and that €350 million has been made available for improving waiting lists this year.
Mr Martin said he wanted to meet with the HSE and CHI to get a “proper assessment” in terms of “actual waiting times” for children and how long individual children are waiting and the reasons for that.
Ms McDonald said some children have waited so long for orthopedic surgery ""that they are now inoperable"". The Dublin Central TD said due to the wait some have experienced, ""children who once walked independently are now in wheelchairs"".
“This is a failure of vulnerable children. Time is of the essence, the longer these children wait for surgical intervention, the more complex procedures they eventually need,” she said.
“The wait is ruining their chance and their right to a normal life, free of pain. It’s not good enough for them to be simply let be.”
The Sinn Féin leader said the Taoiseach “didn’t actually need” long rounds of meetings “to understand what’s happening”.
She described Ava Cahill’s situation, who lives in “considerable and daily pain” because her “feet have turned in on themselves and her condition is worsening”.
“Ava says it’s increasingly difficult for her to do everyday things. Her feet keep getting caught in her pants as she dresses herself and she doesn’t want anyone to see her feet,” Ms McDonald said.
“Ava, like every child, simply wants to do things that her friends do and she so badly needs this operation because she says ’it will make my feet straight and I can tell people that my feet are normal’.”

THE TAOISEACH HAS called on Irish people to “do everything we possibly can” to support Ukrainian people arriving in Ireland following Russia’s invasion of their country.
Micheál Martin said approximately 1,800 Ukrainians have arrived in Ireland since Russia launched its war and the numbers arriving are “growing day by day”.
He said every government department is preparing to ensure that the people are offered the supports they need after arriving in Ireland.
“As of now, about 1,800 have arrived into Ireland, Ukrainian people fleeing the war… Including 486 yesterday, so it is growing and increasing day by day,” the Taoiseach told Newstalk’sPat Kenny Show.

“About two-thirds of arrivals have connections with families in Ireland but that number is decreasing.
“In other words, more and more who don’t have connections with families in Ireland are arriving and it is fair to say we can expect that to increase significantly over the coming weeks.”
The Taoiseach said the crisis sparked by Russia’s aggression on its neighbour is the worst displacement of people in Europe since the second world war.
When asked how Ireland’s housing, health and education sectors would cope with the influx of people, the Fianna Fáil leader said: “The bottom line is this is an exceptional humanitarian crisis brought about by war”.
“It is a wartime situation and therefore our response has to be different to a non-wartime situation and all of us will have to do everything we possibly can to make those services accessible to Ukrainians who are fleeing a war.
“To welcome them and to do everything we possibly can to ease the trauma that they have experienced in recent times, and it will be very, very challenging, I am not pretending otherwise.

Martin said the government aims to house the arriving Ukrainians in State accommodation “insofar as we possibly can”.
He also said that Ireland may need to vaccinate significant numbers of the people against Covid-19.
James Browne, minister of state in the Department of Justice, estimated yesterday that the number of Ukrainian refugees arriving in Irelandcould exceed 80,000.

THE TAOISEACH HAS announced that a suite of measures which aim to tackle rising living costs will be published at the end of this week.
Martin noted that there will be no increase in the base rate of social welfare or a decrease in value added tax (VAT) as part of the measures, saying it’s “not a mini budget”.
He said the increase in global energy prices is particularly responsible for the significant inflation seen in recent months.
The government now suspects that the inflationary cycle may persist in the medium term – longer than was originally forecast by the European Central Bank – so it is taking action.
“We do want to look after people who are hardest hit by the increase in home heating, in terms of fuel, and in terms of basic necessities of life. And the people on low incomes in particular. That, as best we can, to target measures to help people who are suffering as a result of this increase in prices,” Martin toldRTÉ’s This Weekradio programme.

The Fianna Fáil leader singled out health and transport charges as areas where the government can take quick action to help alleviate the pressure on families and others facing financial difficulty.
He said the range of measures are still being finalised and will be announced by the end of this week. He noted that the timing of the impact will vary; with some measures being once-off and others being more sustainable.
Martin added that carbon tax increases will go ahead as planned in May, despite opposition calls for them to be deferred.
“The overwhelming cause of the price increase in fuel and energy is international and global, there’s no question about that. Climate change is a pressing reality and we have to try and avoid short termism in terms of climate change policy,” Martin said.
He added that the government will also announce a major retrofitting programme this week, which will feature “very extensive” grants.
“It’s a major, major retrofitting program, but the funding to enable us to do that comes from the carbon tax. And that is a redistribution of wealth to help those in terms of their weekly, and yearly charges and cost of living. It’s a good measure for reducing emissions as well.”

They know the ordinary god-fearing country people of Ireland will suffer horribly as a result of this hold that Eamon Ryan and his pernicious acolytes have over Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar.
But the Taoiseach continues to dance to the tune of the Greens, railed Mattie McGrath on Tuesday. ""You want people to have no cars, you want people to have no services in rural Ireland and you want to herd them all into the cities.""
Mattie's vision of the future looks bleak enough to bag a Netflix series.
It may be all bicycle clips and fermentation on the outside, but this conceals the dangerous zealot inside
“You don’t want to help the people. You want to let them perish and die in the ditches – that’s what you’re going to do. And that seems be your raison d’etre in politics, which is ‘to hell with the people. Once I am all right, Jack, I’m fine.’”
Perhaps he was being a bit harsh on Micheál.
But the Independent TD for Tipperary and his fellow believers are intensely suspicious of the Greens. It may be all bicycle clips and fermentation on the outside, but this conceals the dangerous zealot inside.
Just look at the stance the Taoiseach has adopted over the carbon tax. His refusal to contemplate reducing it, along with the cost of petrol and diesel, is further proof for the Roaring Independents that Micheál has been well and truly captured by the short and curly bean sprouts.
But he doesn’t agree.
Action must be taken by the Government if climate change is to be addressed and nothing will happen if the Opposition keeps objecting to measures such as carbon tax or a carbon budget. The Taoiseach was taking flak from all sides on the issues, including Jennifer Whitmore of the Soc Dems and Paul Murphy (Sol-PBP), both unhappy at what they saw as the carbon budget being rammed though by the Government without sufficient debate.
The Roaring Independents were, meanwhile, incensed by the rapidly rising cost of fuel.
“What I’m struck with by all of the debates to do with climate change is that everybody wants to delay the day of reckoning, it seems to me, on all fronts,” mused Micheál, adding that in the previous debate on the cost of living, people said his government should postpone the carbon tax.
“And the same will happen with the carbon budgets and everybody will say it’s not enough, but when actual specific measures are going to be put on the table in respect of realising these objectives, everybody will oppose them, ” he sighed.
“I mean, this is going to be the story of climate change for next number of years.”
If he was looking for sympathy he’d come to the wrong place.
“Join the Green Party,” scoffed Mattie.
You see? You see? Micheál pounced. The honour of Eamon Ryan was at stake.
“There you go again! All you seem to want to do is create a bogey, or the bogey [that] the Green Party is the greatest evil since time began.”
“It is,” said Mattie.
Danny Healy-Rae shouted his support. “He’s telling the truth.”
""But they're not, deputy McGrath,"" replied the Taoiseach with an exasperated smile. ""They're not. And the younger generation in the country need us, need this Oireachtas to deal with climate change once and for all. We cannot keep on postponing climate change, we can't keep on delaying climate change.""
But that’s exactly what is happening, said Paul Murphy.
Each time they try to do something “concrete” about the carbon budget they come up against objections, countered Micheál.
When some big world event comes along like “COP26 or whatever, everybody is all ado for about a week or two” and then the objections start again.
Mattie remained unconvinced. All the Taoiseach wants to do is ""dance to the tune"" played by the Greens. If he wanted to do something ""immediate and meaningful"" to help people struggling with the big increases in fuel costs, he could follow the lead of other countries in Europe and cut taxes and cap costs.
This would particularly help people in rural areas where the rising price of road and agricultural diesel is causing real hardship. But then, when it comes to the price of petrol, what would somebody like Micheál Martin know about this?
I don't know the last time you pulled up at a filling station and filled your own car, because you've a driver
The Taoiseach told him it was “very dishonest” to say the carbon tax is the main reason for fuel inflation when global factors are the key contributor. The Government is preparing targeted measures to “cushion the blow” for people worst hit by the rising costs.
Mattie went in for a low, uncushioned blow.
""It's you being dishonest with the people and they know it. I don't know the last time you pulled up at a filling station and filled your own car, because you've a driver. You had one when you were leader of Fianna Fáil and you have State drivers now and everything else. So you don't know, you're out of touch completely.""
The Taoiseach decided not to take the bait. He didn’t rise to it either when Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and Labour’s Ged Nash reminded him of junior Minister Sean Fleming’s dreadful clanger on Monday’s Drivetime when he said people complaining about the cost of living should shop around for lower prices.
They would have been remiss in their duty if they hadn’t brought it up. There won’t be much cushioning the blow for Fleming in the weeks and months to come, when his radio faux pas will be waved around the Dáil chamber by Opposition spokespeople whenever the cost of living comes up.
Meanwhile, the Roaring Independents want a mini-budget as soon as possible even though they know the Taoiseach will shoot it down because he wants to let the people “perish and die in the ditches”. Mattie was incandescent.
No government wants people to perish, no government wants people to die in the ditches. For God's sake, let's have some common sense here
“And you accuse me of being dishonest when I’m telling you the basic naked truth and every dog in the street knows it. That it’s your policy that’s causing the inflation.”
Not to mention taking away people’s cars and services and herding them into all the cities.
“No government wants people to perish, no government wants people to die in the ditches. For God’s sake, let’s have some common sense here and some sense of perspective,” frowned Micheál, pointing to the further measures over and above what is already in the budget “to cushion the blow that this inflationary cycle is imposing on people”.
“It’s basic support and not a cushion they want.”
The Taoiseach, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan have been meeting over the last few days to work on their cost of living bolster.
They will be unveiling the cushion they created at the end of the week.
What a very Green thing to do.
Mattie and the Roaring Independents can say “I told you so” then, but will it soften the blow?

Speaking in Co Kerry on Monday, he said grants to retrofit homes, industries and commercial premises, which were to be announced this week, would reduce bills permanently and were tied to the carbon tax.
He warned against “short-term” thinking to address what was a global problem with oil and gas.
The carbon tax was not that significant in overall inflationary terms, he said.
Mr Martin was speaking in Killarney at the installation of the country's largest combined heat pump and solar PV system at the Tricel engineering and manufacturing plant.
“That is the kind of change we need in this country to meet our climate change objectives,” the Taoiseach said, praising both the energy-efficiency measures and the manufacturing capacity of the plant.
Tricel, started by the Stack family in 1973, now operates in 12 countries and has two plants in France: in Poitiers and in Avignon.
While the 1950s and 1960s were about the opening up of the country to foreign direct investment, the next 50 years would be “about the Tricels of this country”, he said.
Manufacturing autonomy and energy security were to the fore after Covid-19, the Taoiseach said.
There was a need also to rebalance energy use for more security in the supply chain than depending on gas and fuel. Gas would be a transition fuel, but there would have to be “a doubling down” on renewables, he said
Warning against “short-termism” in the response to inflation, which he said was caused by the pandemic and the geopolitical situation and dependence, Mr Martin stressed how the “major measures” on retrofitting homes – to be announced this week – would reduce household energy bills “permanently”, and “for the longer term”.
Of the total allocation of €368 million for energy transformation in the budget, some €202 million to be raised from the carbon tax would be ring-fenced to finance the retrofitting and energy upgrading of residential and community schemes, Mr Martin said.
Revenues generated from the carbon tax would enable homes to permanently reduce their heating costs for years to come. The Government would be making a major announcement on grant assistance this week for retrofitting, he said.
“We have to be careful not to get into short-termism here, that we keep our nerve in terms of the more medium-term plan of retrofitting homes and retrofitting industry commercial premises so that we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels more generally and have a more efficient but also more cost-efficient model where families will have cheaper bills into the future. That has to be the agenda.”
The carbon tax was not that significant in terms of inflation, the Taoiseach stressed.
Asked about Shannon LNG, the liquefied natural gas plant proposed for the Ballylongford to Tarbert landbank along the Shannon estuary in north Kerry and which is once again before An Bord Pleanála, Mr Martin said he had watched it for 20 years, as it went ""on and and off"".
The Government policy was opposed to the importation of fracked gas. Gas would be a transitional fuel, but overall he would prefer to move faster on renewable energy and reduce the overall dependence on fossil fuels.
Wind energy, which is also controversial in the same region in north Kerry because of the proximity of turbines to homes and communities, was the way forward. However, turbines were best off shore, he said.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he will not use the term “apartheid” in describing Israel’s policies against Palestinians following the publication of an Amnesty International report that does so.
Martin described some policies followed by Israel as “counterproductive” but added that using the term apartheid would not “add anything right now”.
Last week, Amnesty Internationallabelled Israel an apartheid statethat treats Palestinians as “an inferior racial group,” joining the assessment of other rights groups which the Jewish state vehemently rejects.
Amnesty stressed it was not comparing the situation to apartheid-era South Africa but that Israeli conduct met the criteria for the crime of apartheid under international law.
New York-based Human Rights Watch in April last year became the first major international rights group to publicly level the allegation.
Amnesty now asserts that Israeli-enforced apartheid exists in occupied Palestinians territories and within Israel itself, where Arab citizens make up more than 20% of the population.
Israel has strongly rejected Amnesty’s claims, with Foreign Minister Yair Lapid saying they were “divorced from reality”.
In the Dáil today, Independent TD Catherine Connolly said that Amnesty’s report was “a damning indictment of what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people”.
She asked Martin whether he had read the report and added:

In response, An Taoiseach said that he visited Gaza in 2009 and that “not much has changed in terms of segregation and the routes Palestinians have to take in the occupied territories”.
He added that the Amnesty report was being examined by the Department of Foreign Affairs and that he also “will get through it as quickly as I can”.
“We believe that Israeli policy is counterproductive to the emergence and triumph of moderate opinion within Palestine, in both the West Bank and Gaza.  In many ways that policy has allowed extremists to get the upper hand, in my view. We have pointed this out time and again,” he said.
Taoiseach Micheál MartinOireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
Connolly disagreed with Martin’s assertion that “very little has changed”, arguing that “the apartheid regime has become entrenched.
“It is no longer just statements from various politicians.  It has become entrenched in legislation, policy and practice, while the suffering of the Palestinian people has intensified,” she said.
Martin said that the Ireland’s voice on Middle Eastern conflict has been “objective and honourable” and that the country is a strong supporter of human rights and relief works.
This included, he said, the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees.
“We fund civil society and have continued to fund civil society and human rights organisations that Israel has labelled as terrorist or whatever,” Martin said.
“We do not accept that labelling and we are pushing our European colleagues to continue to support these organisations. I will not use the term “apartheid” because I am not sure it will add anything right now.”

The introduction of a vacant homes tax in the next budget is a key recommendation of the committee’s report on urban regeneration which will be published on Tuesday.
The committee, chaired by Green Party TD Stephen Matthews, has said the tax could be applied to as many as 137,000 units across the country.
However, while the Government has said that it is committed to introducing such a tax, senior figures, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin, questioned that figure for vacant units, saying it is too high.
“The indications are that the vacancy is not as high as some are saying it is in real terms,” said the Taoiseach on Monday.
“For example in Dublin there are recent reports again indicating that vacancy levels are very . . . with occupancy as high as 96 per cent. That issue needs to be subject to detailed professional analysis before decisions are taken,” he said.
The figure of 137,000 vacant units is predicated on evidence given to the committee by architect Mel Reynolds, in turn based on Central Statistics Office (CSO) data. Mr Reynolds told the committee this suggested about 40,000 units could be brought back into the housing stock relatively quickly. The figures did not include accommodation located above shops.
Separately, data on vacant property has been collected by the Revenue Commissioners through Local Property Tax (LPT) returns. The Department of Finance is using this information, and other sources, to assess the merits and impact of introducing a vacant property tax. “That analysis is now under way for consideration by the Government,” said a spokesman.
Government sources on Monday said the data from LPT and other sources suggests a much lower level of vacancy than figures based on the CSO data. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien told Newstalk on Monday while a vacant property tax is needed there would be situations where good reasons exist as to why homes are vacant, such as the resident being absent due to a long-term illness.
“I don’t think people will want to be taxing people who are in that situation. The tax will not be intended as a revenue-raising tax, rather a disincentive to leaving homes vacant without reason,” said Mr O’Brien.
The report acknowledges the vacancy data is “more nuanced than the statistics show”. It has cited a pilot study conducted by Dublin City Council on 213 potentially vacant homes. Only 49 were confirmed as vacant, of which 16 were vacant long term which was less than 10 per cent of the vacant properties.
It noted the council “advised that this dispels the assumption that there are over 30,000 vacant units in the city as per CSO data”.
In all there are 39 recommendations in the report, some of which deal with the deficits and shortfalls in data collection. A key recommendation is for a single national platform for data on vacancy and dereliction.
The report will also recommend that Revenue be asked to collect the money raised from the derelict site levy and the vacant site tax in light of evidence that only a small fraction of that owed is being collected.
According to the report, only €378,000 has been collectedfrom €5.45 million imposed as levies on derelict sites. In all, the outstanding unpaid charges for the derelict sites levy have risen to €12.5 million. The figure is even worse for the vacant site tax. Of €21.5 million owed to local authorities only €21,000 has been collected, which amounts to 1 percent of what is owed.
In recommending the Revenue be brought in to collect the levies and taxes, the committee has concluded that “it is difficult to suggest the [taxes are] being implemented successfully. There should be a renewed effort to address this.”

THE SINN FÉIN leader has claimed that the Rental Tax Credit could “fuel a further rent hike”.
During Leaders’ Questions this afternoon, Mary Lou McDonald accused Taoiseach Micheál Martin of leaving “the door wide open for more rent hikes, more exploitation, and more hardship”.
She added: “Taoiseach, you have messed this up, and the renters of Ireland deserve more than this half-baked measure. So I want you to correct it.”
McDonald called on the government to “give renters a real break by putting a month’s rent back into their pockets through a refundable tax credit” and “provide certainty and protection by banning rent increases for three years”.
However, Martin noted that “there is a 2% limit on the rent pressure zones as we speak”.
Rental Tax Credit
Anew tax credit for renterswas one of the measures introduced in yesterday’s €11 billion budget.
It’s worth €500 per calendar year and will apply for 2022, and can be claimed until 2025.
Around 400,000 people will be eligible for the tax credit, which will cost the Exchequer around €200 million.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe confirmed yesterday that landlords must be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board in order for tenants to avail of the tax credit.
Landlords are required by law to register their tenancy but this isn’t always done, as was the case with numerous TDs who rented out properties.
The Sinn Féin leader said it “won’t make a dent for people paying average rents of over €2,000 per month in Dublin, or those paying nearly €1,500 a month across the state”.

McDonald also claimed that the Taoiseach previously said that a Rental Tax Credit “would be inflationary and would add to rent prices”.
She added that because the Rental Tax Credit is non-refundable, it has “left out students and low income workers”.
However, the Taoiseach said the budget had to be “viewed in its entirety” and that the government is “helping the most vulnerable in our society”.
He also pointed to “very strong supports for students” that were enacted in yesterday’s budget, which includes a once-off €1,000 reduction in student contribution for eligible students and a once-off double payment of the Susi maintenance grant.
Martin noted that the Fiscal Advisory Council “described Budget 2023 as sensible, and said that government has managed to direct resources to those who need it most”.
Martin said that the figures in Sinn Féin’s alternative housing budget “don’t add up” and would leave a “€300 million black hole”.
‘Housing disaster’
Mary Lou McDonald responded by claiming that a “housing crisis has morphed into a housing disaster” under Martin’s time in office as Taoiseach.
She called on the Taoiseach to “correct” the housing budget and pointed to “three design errors”.
McDonald said: “€500 is not enough when you are facing the types of rents that people are paying. The tax credit is not refundable and that means students and low income workers are excluded.
“And crucially, for this to work, there has to be a ban on rent increases for three years.”
However, Martin said her proposals “would drive more houses out of the housing market”.
He said: “Every year, less people are renting out houses and the ban would have a detrimental effect on this.”
He added that McDonald “needs to get real in terms of the market” and claimed that “people don’t want to let out houses anymore because of the endless vilification that people like Deputy (Eoin) O’Broin fire upon people on an on-going basis”.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has described anti-gay andtransgendercomments made by a Kerry priest as ‘wrong’, ‘hurtful’ and ‘not the language of Christianity’.
Mr Martin is the latest in a string of Government politicians and members of the clergy to denounce the claim by Fr Seán Sheehy that gay politicians and those who support same-sex marriage will go to hell if they ‘don’t repent on sin and seek forgiveness’.
Bishop of Kerry Ray Browne has also apologised for Fr Sheehy’s Sunday homilies in Listowel that condemned transgenderism, abortion, same-sex couples, and supplying condoms to teenagers.
The Taoiseach said: ‘Those remarks were wrong, very disturbing, pretty hurtful to people generally, and in the LGBTQI community.’
Mr Martin is the latest in a string of Government politicians to denounce the claim by Father Seán Sheehy that gay politicians and those who support same-sex marriage will go to hell
He continued: ‘In my view the language used was not the language of Christianity, and certainly would seem to me to be the language of exclusion as opposed to inclusion.
'I think many people were taken aback by that.’
A spokesman for the openly gay Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said earlier this week that he ‘profoundly disagrees’ with Fr Sheehy’s views but ‘respects his right to express his religious beliefs freely’.
‘The Tánaiste does not believe that gay people will go to hell for being who they are, nor does he believe that any man or woman can make such a judgment,’ the spokesman said.
‘As Pope Francis said, “Who are we to judge?”’
Last Sunday, Fr Sheehy – deputising for Listowel parish priest Fr Declan O’Connell, who is on a pilgrimage – declared in his homily: ‘You rarely hear about sin, but it’s rampant, it’s rampant.
Father Sheehy (pictured) condemned transgenderism, abortion, same-sex couples, and supplying condoms to teenagers
'We see it in the legislation of our Government.
'We see it in the promotion of abortion. We see it for example in this lunatic approach to transgenderism.
‘We see it, for example, in the promotion of sex between two men and two women. That is sinful. That is a mortal sin and people don’t seem to realise it.
‘It’s a fact, a reality, and we need to listen to God about it because if we don’t, then there is no hope for those people.’
He later insisted that he stood by his remarks, explaining: ‘I do, because it is based on the scriptures and the teaching of the Church.’
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Bishop of Kerry said: ‘I am aware of the deep upset and hurt caused by the contents of the homilies in question delivered over the weekend.
‘I apologise to all who were offended. The views expressed do not represent the Christian position. The homily at a regular weekend parish Mass is not appropriate for such issues to be spoken of in such terms.’
Fr Sheehy appears to be aware of the storm of controversy his comments provoked, saying in church earlier this week that what he had said in the sermons was the truth.
It was reported that he got a round of applause from some church-goers, but that not everyone joined in.
Fr Sheehy is a retired priest, who spent most of his working life in the United States, returning to his native Co. Kerry in 2007 from his final post in Louisiana.
He was one of two priests assigned to Kerry parishes on a loan basis from their US dioceses, due to the chronic shortage of priests in Ireland.
Less than two years later, he provoked outrage and was forced to resign his post after providing a character reference for a man convicted of sexually assaulting a woman.
Fr Sheehy described the man as being always respectful of women, and maintained there was ‘not an abusive bone in his body’.
The priest was one of dozens of people who queued to embrace and shake hands with the convicted man before he was sentenced to seven years in jail.
The then Bishop of Kerry, Bill Murphy, issued a statement in which he said he wished to disassociate himself and the diocese from the actions and statements made by Fr Sheehy.

Addressing over 2,500 delegates at his party’s árdfheis at the RDS in Dublin, its first since Fianna Fáil entered government in 2020, Mr Martin was enthusiastically received by activists when he made his televised address on Saturday evening.
He declared that the “greatest divide in our politics today is between those who want to tackle our country’s problems and those who want to exploit them” and placed Fianna Fáil firmly in the former group.
He contrasted Fianna Fáil, which “sees politics as the means to advance the interests of the nation” and the Opposition — without naming Sinn Féin — as “those who only care about attacking others.”

“Let no one be in any doubt where Fianna Fáil stands,” he said, to applause. “We believe in taking action”.
“We believe in the hard work of finding solutions, creating opportunities, and making Ireland a stronger, fairer country.”
He condemned those who see Ireland as a “failed state” and embarked on a list of the achievements of his party in office since its foundation.
“Two million more people live in our republic today than did one hundred years ago, and in area after area Ireland and her people’s lives have been transformed.
“There is no doubt that today we face real and urgent challenges, there are many in our society who need our help — but those who dismiss the progress we have achieved and seek to tell a story of Ireland as some type of ‘failed state’ are deliberately misleading our people and selling our country short,” Mr Martin said.
He also hailed the Government’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic which he said had resulted in Ireland having far fewer deaths than both the European average and the UK.
Mr Martin also drew applause when he spoke about the Shared Island initiative, a scheme to finance cross-Border projects which he has personally championed.
“For the first time in our history where there is a sustained investment to support vital North/South projects, to build deeper connections and understanding,” he said. “Projects that have been talked about for decades are now under way.”
He said the initiative had resulted in “the most inclusive dialogue ever between communities” as well as “a major series of research studies to start properly understanding the differences, similarities and opportunities in relation to health services, trade, childcare, education and other vital areas between North and South.”
He promised that when the Government ended its term, people would see “real progress for the Irish people”, in the shape of “a new era of social and affordable housing, healthcare which is more accessible and affordable, investment in childcare and education, support for strong communities, moving from words to action on a shared island.”
While Mr Martin’s speech did not mention Sinn Féin by name, the Minister for Education Norma Foley, who delivered the warm-up speech before the Taoiseach’s address, devoted much of her contribution to attacks on the main opposition party, much to the delight of delegates.

POLITICS IN IRELAND is divided between those who want to tackle the country’s problems and those who want to exploit them, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has claimed.
Martin was addressing the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in the RDS in Dublin, where the party’s identity and what it stands for formed a key pillar of discussion.
It was Martin’s first and only in-person Ard Fheis as Taoiseach, since the event was moved online during the pandemic.
He was met with applause when he told members: “There is no doubt that today we face real and urgent challenges. There are many in our society who need our help – but those who dismiss the progress we have achieved and seek to tell a story of Ireland as some type of ‘failed state’ are deliberately misleading our people and selling our country short.
“Between those who see politics as the means to advance the interests of the nation and those who only care about attacking others.
“Let no one be in any doubt where Fianna Fáil stands – we believe in taking action.”

The Ard Fheis comes as Government housing policy faces scrutiny, following new figures which show that homelessness is at anall-time high.
An Ireland Thinks/Sunday Independent opinion poll published this evening puts Martin’s party as the third-most popular in Ireland, with 17% support, an increase of one percentage point. Sinn Féin has hit its highest-ever rating in such a poll, with 37% – also up one percentage point.
Earlier today, Martin insisted he had confidence in Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien and the Housing for All plan.
In his speech, the Taoiseach conceded that Ireland’s level of homelessness was “unacceptable”.
“Our action on housing is not being felt by everyone yet … but there are immediate actions which are being taken.

“The emptiness of the opposition’s policy, their lack of a credible alternative shows that they know that our plans will deliver and they are doing everything they can to block them.
“They claim to care about housing but have objected to 6,000 homes in Dublin alone in the last two years.” (The Journal’s FactCheck has previouslyexamined this claimand found it to be misleading.)
War in Ukraine
Martin was met with applause and some attendees rising to their feet when he addressed the Ambassador to Ukraine, who was in attendance “I want to assure you that this party will not waver in our support for you and your future as a member of the European Union.
Sam Boal / RollingNews.ieSam Boal / RollingNews.ie / RollingNews.ie
“”We understand what it means to be a small nation seeking freedom and defending its culture. That’s why as a country we have been so open and strong in our support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression.”
He said price hikes due to the war will “hopefully be short term in their impact”, particularly energy prices, but “others will likely be more permanent.”
Shared island
Taking place on the same day as the Ard Fheis was Together We Can, a conference on Irish unity organised by the Ireland’s Future group. The Taoiseach made reference to the future of Northern Ireland in his speech:
Referring once again to Fianna Fáil as a party of “real action”, he said: “There has been a lot of talk about unity and reconciliation but very little work done to actually build the bridges which make it happen.
“Central to our identity as a party is that we believe in the Republican vision set out in 1916 of a country which truly unites all the people of our island, which respects diversity, different identities and puts behind it the divisions of the past.
And we believe that it is the duty of every one of us to do the hard work of building understanding, unity and a sense of shared community.
“That is our work. That is our commitment.”

Shawn Pogatchnik,Ireland laughs off Kremlin’s travel ban on its leaders,"'I don’t think I’ve ever been sanctioned before,' Prime Minister Micheál Martin says with a chuckle as he tops Moscow's list of 52 punished Irish politicians.",https://www.politico.eu/article/ireland-kremlin-travel-ban-leaders-micheal-martin-leo-varadkar/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,europeanvoice,general,en,us,2022-11-16T14:36:53+00:00,"‘I don’t think I’ve ever been sanctioned before,’ Prime Minister Micheál Martin says with a chuckle as he tops Moscow’s list of 52 punished Irish politicians.
DUBLIN — The Kremlin has banned most, if not all, of Ireland’s leaders from visiting Russia — a punishment being met with official indifference and unofficial mockery in Dublin.
The Foreign Ministry in Moscow defended Wednesday’s action as necessary to counteract what it called Ireland’s “aggressive anti-Russian propaganda campaign” and “Russophobic hysteria in Irish society.”
Thestatementclaimed 52 Irish politicians have been banned from Russian soil. It specified six: Prime MinisterMicheál Martin, Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Eurogroup President and Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, Justice Minister Helen McEntee, and the parliament speaker, Seán Ó Fearghaíl.
None of their six offices offered any official reaction, although aides to Martin and Varadkar — who is due to succeed Martin as prime minister on December 17 under terms of their coalition government — said neither had plans to visit Russia in any event.
Complicating matters, Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed to POLITICO that Russia had provided no list identifying the 52 people. Its officials were seeking “immediate clarification” from Russian embassy officials on Dublin’s Orwell Road, a spokesman said.
In parliament, lawmakerNeale Richmondasked Martin whether the time had come to expel Russia’s ambassador and shut itssuspiciously large embassy, widely seen here as a Russian base in the EU for spying, surveillance and social media influence operations.
Richmond said Ireland should “cut off this constant channel of disinformation and aggression from these so-called diplomats.”
In reply, Martin smiled and laughed as he observed: “I don’t think I’ve ever been sanctioned before.” He called the anti-Irish statement “part of a broader propaganda war being waged by Russia.”
But he said diplomatic channels must be kept open with Moscow, “no matter how unpalatable it can be at certain times. Cool heads are always required in situations like this.”
Outside the chamber, politicians traded jokes over lunch in the nearby parliamentary canteen. One claimed to be seeking a travel agent’s refund for a prebooked bear-wrestling holiday in Siberia. Others pointed to the shame of failing to make the Kremlin’s list of important politicians.
Interparty ribbing focused on the fact that Moscow’s missive dwelled on ministers from Varadkar’s Fine Gael party at the apparent expense of Martin’s Fianna Fáil.
While both parties are co-equals in the coalition formed in mid-2020, Fine Gael has been widely seen to command more public attention, in part because of Varadkar’s penchant for headline-grabbing and Fine Gael’s lopsided hold of the finance, justice and foreign affairs portfolios.
The only other Fianna Fáiler name-checked by Moscow was Ó Fearghaíl, the neutral arbiter of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of parliament.
Richmond, who is Fine Gael’s spokesman on European affairs, said he didn’t know if he was on the Kremlin’s naughty list but told POLITICO he considered its move “a petulant act of a desperate regime.”

Micheál Martin is currently rocking HITSMISIFIT. And Leo Varadkar has, from December 17th until whenever, to come up with an equally snappy acronym to define his time as taoiseach. That DKAAHF from his previous stint really doesn’t cut the mustard.
Who can forget Enda’s famously fintistic Ireland is “the best small country in the world in which to do business” slogan?
Oh.
The jury is still out on Leo. “Dear Kylie Am A Huge Fan” just isn’t a signature saying.
The Taoiseach has been working really, really hard to establish one: “Housing is the single most important social issue facing Ireland today” while simultaneously trying to retain possession of it in the teeth of strong Opposition pressure.
In an unusual turn of events, a feature of Dáil exchanges in recent weeks has been a sharp escalation in the battle to claim bragging rights for being the first political party to twig that the country’s housing infrastructure is an absolute shambles.
Mary Lou McDonald couldn’t have arrived in the Dáil any faster had she been shot from a cannon
For months, Micheál’s stock response to Opposition leaders lambasting him about the situation has been to repeat the “housing is the single most important ...” mantra as proof of his own and his Government’s bona fides in dealing with this difficult matter. Yet they persist in accusing him – and the Minister for Housing – of not fully recognising the crisis.
Then a few weeks ago, when Darragh O’Brien was asked by Virgin Media’s Claire Brock if there is a “housing emergency”, the Minister barged in with his hobnail boots and replied: “No, I don’t.” He hastily added that an accommodation crisis exists and is indeed an emergency for “many people” but the damage was done.
Mary Lou McDonald couldn’t have arrived in the Dáil any faster had she been shot from a cannon.
“Taoiseach, can I put it to you, do you accept this is a catastrophe?” thundered the Sinn Féin leader at the time. “Do you accept that we are living through a housing emergency? If, like your Minister, you do not, that goes a very long way to explain your abject failure in meeting the housing needs of people.”
You can see Micheál’s irritation every time he is asked this sort of question and is forced to roll out his HITSMISIFIT line again.
Labour’s Ivana Bacik has also been tormenting him over who cares most in this calamity. The day after Mary Lou’s remarks she informed him the housing crisis is really an emergency “despite the Government’s failure and refusal to call it such”.
But no matter how many times he insists his administration is acutely aware that housing is the single most important social issue facing Ireland today, they don’t listen.
At one point the Taoiseach told Mary Lou: “You’re not the first to come up with the term ‘emergency’.”
In terms of political point scoring in the chamber, that’s a new one on us. He gave chapter and verse of when he first declared our housing crisis to be a “social emergency”. Apparently it was at a policy launch in September of 2021.
And he quoted himself again to Ivana the following day.
On Wednesday this week, in a brief break from bricks and mortar, Mary Lou decided to turn her attention to the continuing “fiasco surrounding delivery of the national children’s hospital”. In World Cup parlance, this would be called “an open goal”.
But why let that stop her from getting in a bonus dig at the other fiasco: Micheál’s “emergency”, so good he named it first.
“There has been, rightly, a lot of focus on your inability to build houses, but clearly you’re not good at building hospitals either.”
Back of the net!
Deputy McDonald was having a field day, peppering the Coalition penalty area with her disdain and listing Fiasco, Debacles, Bungles and Incompetence like a commentator reading out Micheál’s defensive line.
The hospital will open a decade behind schedule at the earliest, and the latest screamer from the Department of Health is that the bill for it is likely to top the two billion mark. So what is going to be the final cost, when will it be finished and open for business?
The Taoiseach got to his feet.
“Who do you think I am? Nostradamus? How long is a piece of string?”
He didn’t actually say that. But you know he wanted to. There was no chance he was going to challenge for bragging rights as the first politician to claim this dumpster fire as an emergency.
“I would first of all make the point that, of course, the children’s hospital has been a project that has been ongoing for quite some considerable length of time, well in advance of the formation ofthisgovernment.” So let there be no pinning of the blame on Micheál Martin and Fianna Fáil.
Nonetheless, it is one of the most important projects in the country “managed” by others but “clearly overseen” by the Government. And because the children of Ireland will benefit from a first-class, world-class hospital their objective is “to complete this and to get the hospital done”.
Which is a relief as it’s already half built. He wouldn’t talk about the ultimate cost and had no intention of prejudicing what is a live contract. “That would be a mistake ... you don’t announce to the contractor the level which you want to go to.”
There are other issues too. “Obviously, the war in Ukraine and the cost of building materials and so on will impact.”
Mary Lou concluded that both he and the Minister – no, not Darragh O’Brien this time, but Stephen Donnelly – have “no notion” of what the final bill will be.
He didn’t disagree.
Then Ivana Bacik steered him back to the other debacle. As they say in World Cup parlance, all credit to the Taoiseach for being the first to call it an emergency. The Labour leader brought up the shocking story of an unauthorised development off Dublin’s Camden Street where the 27 residents, mainly young overseas students, have been given two weeks notice to quit by the landlord because the two-storey corrugated metal structure has been condemned as a fire hazard. They are each paying €500-€600 a month for a tiny room, three shared toilets and two shared showers and cannot source alternative accommodation anywhere in Dublin
Their plight was highlighted by Kitty Holland in Tuesday’s Irish Times. The unfolding situation at “the ironically named Liberty Lane ... is one example of the really sharp end of the housing disaster that we are seeing”, said Deputy Bacik.
[Dublin tenants told to leave fire hazard building in less than two weeksOpens in new window]
“I was very concerned when I read that article,” replied the Taoiseach, noting that the council is pursuing “an enforcement issue”. He commended the authorities for taking action as the property is a fire hazard.
Ivana agreed it was the right thing to do, but moreover, what does Liberty Lane say about the housing crisis when people are choosing to live in such conditions out of desperation because there is nowhere else to rent in the city?
People Before Profit’s Bríd Smith also mentioned the dangerous lodgings and the businessman running it.
“Will this State move against landlords who exploit the housing crisis to profiteer from it in this way in order to prevent anyone else doing it?”
The Taoiseach didn’t comment for fear of “prejudicing any case that may arise”.
But at the very outset, he was grateful to Ivana for her housing question because, well, HITSMISIFIT.
“I thank the Deputy for raising what I have said consistently is the single most important issue facing us as a society.”

AN TAOISEACH MICHEÁL Martin has called on the DUP to “honour” the mandate of the people of Northern Ireland by contributing to the restoration of the Stormont institutions as the election deadline looms.
Commenting yesterday, Martin said that it did not appear that there would be an agreement reached by Friday:
“From the meetings I had on Monday there doesn’t appear to be a likelihood that the Executive or the Assembly will be restored by the deadline.”
The Taoiseach added that it is “not satisfactory” that the powersharing institutions are not functioning.
There is less than a week to form a Stormont executive before the UK’s Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris will be obliged by law to call a fresh assembly election.
The DUP is refusing to nominate ministers to form a new executive until the Westminster Government takes decisive action on the Northern Ireland Protocol.

They argue that the post-Brexit arrangements hamper trade and place a border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Speaking at Fianna Fail’s annual party dinner in Dublin on Saturday, Martin said:
“The British Government are adamant and the outgoing government was adamant that there will be elections. We will engage with the British Government ministers over the coming days to keep abreast of the situation.
‘Stop-start’
The Fianna Fail leader said there has been too much “stop-start” with the Stormont institutions.
“It’s never satisfactory, in my view, that after elections, the assembly doesn’t get established, or the executive, and I think, historically, we’ve had too much stop-start with the assembly and with the executive over different periods, and that’s simply not good enough,” he said.

The Fianna Fáil leader is set to hand over the post of taoiseach to the Fine Gael leader,Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, in December 2022, under the terms of the government deal agreed between the two parties and the Green Party.
Asked about the future government, Mr Martin said his key focus is policy and “getting the work done”.
He said future ministerial posts will be considered closer to the time.
“When I became Taoiseach I was anxious that we would create structures that would enable us to deliver on the policy objectives within the programme for government,” he said.
“And to that extent we set up a fairly significant subcommittee structure within cabinet, particularly the key critical areas of housing, of climate, of economy, health, and education.
“And those committees are very important for not just getting into the fine detail of policy, but also following through and monitoring delivery.
“So my focus, and this is still early years in this government, is to really deliver now on the key commitments.
“We’ve made great progress, I would argue, so far. So I’m not speculating what’s going to happen in 12 months time in terms of specific ministries or anything like that, that would be a matter that would be considered closer to that time.”
Mr Martin said his ministers were “doing very well” and stressed the importance of consistency.
“I am of a view that consistency of policy and delivery is important,” he said.
“Chopping and changing all of the time might look good for a day or two, but nothing can beat the substance of getting real change.”
Mr Martin described Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath as ""very effective and solid"", working with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to take the economy through on of its largest upsets in 100 years.
“I think it’s the fastest recession we’ve had and deepest recession, but we’ve bounced back, along with our European colleagues, but in Ireland, we’ve bounced back very significantly,” he said.
“And so I think economically, the Government has done very well, in the context of a pandemic, fastest growing in Europe and quarter three employment almost back now above pre-pandemic levels.”
He described Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien as having put together a very comprehensive Housing for All strategy, with substance and funding, while he said Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has been ""very, very effective"".
Mr Martin described Norman Foley has having been a ""very authoritative"" Minister for Education, and commended Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly for presiding, he said, over one of the best vaccination programmes in Europe, if not the world.
The Taoiseach added: “People are only a year and a half in office and I think they’re all working very well, as are the ministers of state, all having significant legislation under their belt and getting important legislation passed, as well as initiatives particularly in mental health, older people and disabilities.” – PA

BreakingNews.ie,Taoiseach ‘hopeful’ current restrictions will be lifted at the end of January,Micheál Martin said the country is making progress against Omicron.,https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/taoiseach-hopeful-current-restrictions-will-be-lifted-at-the-end-of-january-1242617.html,breakingnews,general,en,ie,2022-01-14T14:52:18+00:00,"By Cate McCurry, PA
The Taoiseach said he is hopeful Covid restrictions can be removed at the end of the month, allowing events and the hospitality sector to open after 8pm.
The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is meeting next Thursday and will advise the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the current restrictions.
﻿
Micheál Martin said the country is making progress against Omicron.
“I would hope that we would be in a position to move forward in terms of the current restrictions, but I’m not in a position yet to say anything definitive about that,” Mr Martin said on Friday.


“I want to really see what the public health people are saying, and also having a sense of where Omicron is.
“So far, I think, so good in respect of the fact that it’s not translating into ICU (intensive care unit) attendances. The case numbers seem to be levelling. So we are hopeful in terms of the progress we’ve made to date.”
From Friday, close contacts who have had their booster jab and do not have any symptoms will no longer have to isolate.
They are, however, advised to wear a higher grade masks and to continue taking regular antigen tests.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said he would be reluctant to see any of thecurrent restrictionsremoved until the number of people with Covid in hospital begins to fall.
I think we’d like to see hospital numbers and ICU numbers falling before we feel comfortable about easing restrictions




The Fine Gael leader said he did not want to speculate on when the restrictions will be removed because it is “not fair” on people working in events and hospitality.
“What they want is clear messages. And what they want to know is what the new rules are going to be and when they kick in,” Mr Varadkar said.
“What they don’t want is different politicians saying different things and speculating about what might or might not happen.
“What I will say is that Nphet is going to meet on January 20th. We’d expect them to provide advice to Minister Donnelly that evening. That will allow Government then to make a decision in the days after that.”
He said the hospitality sector will get “decent advance notice” of any easing of restrictions.
Mr Varadkar added: “I think in terms of data, where we’re focusing less on cases and more on the numbers of people in hospital and the numbers of people in ICU.




“It’s not yet clear that the numbers in hospital has peaked. It’s still over 1,000 and in ICU is just over 100.
“I think we’d like to see hospital numbers and ICU numbers falling before we feel comfortable about easing restrictions.
“But the plan is that the current restrictions remain in place until January 31.
“Nphet will meet on the 20th and will advise Government at that point. We should be able to give businesses that are restricted clear information and clarity about what will happen in February well before anything happens.”

EU leaders are meeting to discuss the issue in Brussels ahead of a joint summit with the African Union, with the mass build-up of Russian troops around Ukraine's borders threatening to overshadow the agenda.
""The European Union has made it clear that if Russia invades Ukraine, there will be united response, it will be robust and very, very significant. It will be in the form of sanctions,"" Mr Martin told journalists, adding that the sanctions would be enforced ""very quickly"".
On Thursday Ukrainian forces and Moscow-backed rebels both accused the other of firing across a ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine, the site of conflict since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.
Russia has blamed Nato for provoking the tensions, and has denied planning an invasion as Western leaders warned that Russia's forces numbering more than 100,000 with significant hardware and even field hospitals would allow it to attack at short notice.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said there has not yet been ""significant withdrawal"" of Russian troops and equipment from the region around the Ukrainian border, despite Russian announcements that some military exercises had ended.
Mr Coveney said Ireland will push for ""sustained and credible moves"" towards genuine de-escalation at the UN Security Council, which will meet in New York on Thursday and be addressed by US secretary of state Anthony Blinken.
Mr Coveney said sustained and credible moves means “significant withdrawal of both troops and equipment. We have not yet seen this.”
“Our Ambassador in New York will reiterate today Ireland’s full commitment to the core principles enshrined in the UN Charter, including the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States,” he said.
Mr Coveney said the only way forward was through diplomacy and dialogue with existing mechanisms, including the Normandy format and the OSCE.
“Eastern Ukraine has already endured eight years of conflict, resulting in a humanitarian disaster, serious human rights violations and abuses, as reported by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It is time for a serious commitment to de-escalation, diplomacy and compromise,” he said.
Mr Martin reiterated the need for de-escalation: “There is no justification whatsoever in our view, for the massing of so many troops and military hardware on the borders of the Ukraine.
“Our hearts go to the people of Ukraine who are under a lot of pressure right now from what is a very intimidatory and threatening amassing of significant troops on their border.”
The Taoiseach dismissed Moscow’s claims that Ukrainian forces and the West have been the aggressors. “There is no sense from my perspective that there’s any threat to Russia right now, from the Ukraine or from anybody else,” Mr Martin said.
“The sense I have for meeting European leaders is they want to de-escalate all of this, and they certainly do not want conflict.”
The Department of Foreign Affairs is in contact with 98 Irish citizens in Ukraine who have registered with the Embassy in Kyiv.

With the Covid-19 pandemic finally appearing to lose its impact, office workers have once more been given the thumbs up to return to their places of employment by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.
For many office workers, it has been almost two years since they sat with their co-workers – or at least since they did so with any great regularity.
While some will race back, others, buffeted by no commuting time, cheaper lunches and the absence of pesky colleagues, may be more reluctant to return.
The question then perhaps is, can the office as we know it survive in a future which may be dominated by hybrid and remote working?
The office is dead. Long live the office!
The past two years has undoubtedly had an impact on the office market. Figures from Knight Frank show that total office investment came to €1.5 billion in 2021, while total office take-up reached just over 1.63m sq ft. “An excellent out-turn” says Joan Henry, chief economist and head of research with Knight Frank Ireland, given the extent of lockdowns during that period.
But one that is still far short of where it once was.
Overall investment for example is down significantly on the €3.1 billion invested in 2019, while the office take-up is also down considerably on the 3.9 million let in 2018, and the 3.3 million in 2019.
The vacancy rate also shot up during the pandemic – from about 6 per cent, pre-Covid, to a peak of 10.6 per cent in the middle of 2021.
Rents fell too, down to about €57.50 per sq ft from more than €60 pre-pandemic.
However, while it may be down, the office market is far from out.
For John Moran, chief executive and head of capital markets with JLL in Ireland, the pessimism was unwarranted.
“I always felt the death of the office was overdone and premature,” he says.
Indeed a number of high profile deals last year, such as the €395 million sale of Facebook’s Ballsbridge campus to Blackstone, as well as TikTok’s agreement to lease the entire 210,000sq ft Sorting Office, illustrate the high level of interest in prime Dublin office space.
Already, in another mark of confidence, the supply of so-called “grey space” or offices ready for occupation, has fallen, from a high of about 1.1m sq ft to 1m sq ft and Knight Frank expects it to fall further.
Unsurprisingly then, the vacancy rate has also started to turn, down to 9.8 per cent for the fourth quarter of 2021. Knight Frank expects it to continue to decline in 2022.
Also, the drop in rents wasn’t as deep as had been feared.
“We thought rents would go further south,” says Moran.
Now Knight Frank is forecasting that prime rents will reach €62.50per sq ft by mid-year and €65 per sq ft by the end of the year, up by 13 per cent on 2021. With the market having been on hold for much of the past 24 months Henry says the scene is now set for a “potential race for space, particularly in the city centre”.
Hybrid working
It’s a notably positive outlook given many people will never use their offices as they once did.
“I think there’s broadly an acceptance that we’re going to operate in a sort of hybrid model,” says Moran, adding, “I don’t see buildings going back to 100 per cent occupancy”.
Indeed professional services firm Pwc, for example, has told its staff to expect to be in the office for two to three days a week on average, post pandemic, while some employers have gone fully remote. Back in 2020, in the early days of the pandemic, recruitment group Indeed said it would allow the “vast majority” of its 1,000 Irish employees to work from home forever.
“Everyone rightly assumes there’ll be a hybrid working model moving forward, but from one company to another it will be very different,” says Shane Duffy, director of offices with Savills Ireland. “What works for one company may not work for another.”
It will take a while until more clarity returns. As Duffy notes, “Everyone’s looking around to see what everyone else is doing”.
Already since the restrictions on office working, among other things, have been lifted, Moran is seeing a “significant upsurge” in occupier activity, as companies again start to consider just what sort of space they need.
What will happen next is businesses will start analysing how their space is being used and then make decisions. This could see more space being assigned for hot desks, or a reduction in desk space in favour of meeting spaces.
“There is always going to be a need for an office, a requirement for some base point for occupiers to come and meet. Will it be full of linear desks like before? Probably unlikely,” says Duffy, adding that the office will be more about a space to congregate and socialise.
This new approach may not, however, mean a reduction in space.
“We haven’t seen a huge amount of people trying to downsize,” says Moran, “but what we are seeing is people maybe not over-committing to space the way they did in the past”.
Take professional services firm KPMG. Pre-Covid, it went to the market looking to lease 320,000sq ft; in the end it transacted almost 290,000sq ft, so a 10 per cent decrease. Not a huge reduction then, given the experience of the past two years – and it still has an option to lease up to a further 48,500sq ft.
It is this flexible approach, with an option of ramping up or down as the business needs it, that we’re likely to see more of.
“Alienation clauses [which allow tenants to sub-let or not] are going to be particularly important going forward,” says Duffy, noting “what’s relevant right now may not be relevant in two/four years”.
In the future then, companies may look to take an option of further space, or seek out flexible work spaces that allow them to ramp up or down as they need it. Companies are also likely to want shorter lease terms.
There may also be a further dichotomy between newer, ESG (environmental, social and governance) compliant buildings, and older stock.
“We’re undoubtedly going to see a brand discount,” says Moran.
There is also a differential in demand for property in central business districts and further afield. In the suburbs, the outlook “is a little bit trickier” concedes Duffy.
A compulsion to return to the office may also emerge over time. With most people working from home in an organisation, the sense of missing out was not an issue. Now, with one cohort in the office, and another potentially at home, there could be more of a pull to spend time with colleagues – especially if those colleagues are seen to being treated better.
“There is a huge appetite amongst the younger generation to get back into an office in some capacity, to be there and learn from tCan demand for office space withstand the move to hybrid working?heir peers,” says Duffy, noting that “out of sight is out of mind” might become an issue in dividing those who stay at home and those who come to the office.
On the other hand, if companies and their employees fully embrace the remote model, what will this mean for companies like Indeed who have offices at St Stephen’s Green and Sir John Rogerson’s Quay? Will it continue to retain such expansive office space? The company has previously indicated it would revisit leases as they come up for renewal.
City centres
Another great unknown is what’s going to happen to all those cafes and coffee shops that have been bolstered thus far by Government pandemic subsidies. When these finally come to an end, will there be enough people around to ensure their viability? After all, if the hybrid model is the dominant one, an employee who is only at their desk for three days a week will only be spending 60 per cent of what they previously did on lunch and coffees.
Already this has started to hit home.
On St Stephen’s Green, Hatch & Sons, the cafe owned by Peaches and Domini Kemp recently closed, due to a collapse in revenues. The sisters attributed this to “simply not enough tourists or office workers to sustain sales in any meaningful way”.
On Pearse Street, Eimer Rainsford, owner of Honey Truffle, a cafe offering delectable lunchtime treats for the office crew has weathered the storm of the previous two years.
“The last two years have been a rollercoaster,” she says, noting the importance of Government subsidies in keeping the business running. Now she’s happily eyeing up queues returning to her premises – “We haven’t had that in a long time” – but remains cautious about just how the return to the office will play out.
On the one hand, she notes a number of businesses that have pulled out in the vicinity, “I get concerned about that”, but on the other hand, she’s noted an uptick in younger people who are seeking out a return to the office, while there is also considerable construction of new office space in the area. “It’s still a learning curve.”

The National Public Health Emergency Team will meet today to discuss easing restrictions over the next few weeks.
Health officials will make recommendations to Government ahead of a Cabinet meeting tomorrow.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin told a meeting of his Parliamentary Party last night the country is now well beyond the peak of the Omicron wave and things weren’t as bad as had been feared.
He said he plans to make an announcement tomorrow on restrictions for the short and medium term.
While politicians are not under any illusions the pandemic is over, they are beginning to think the worst may be behind – at least until a new variant emerges.
With that in mind they expect a quick unwinding of restrictions over the next few weeks, with hopes almost all measures will be gone before the bumper four day St Patrick’s weekend.
However, NPHET has still to have its say.
Health officials will meet to set out what measures they believe can be eased, and the pace at which it should be done.
It’s expected they will give a cautious go ahead to re-opening, with full details of the plan to be sent to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly tonight.

LAST UPDATE|22 Feb 2022
GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF Scholz says Germany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
Speaking in a joint press conference in Berlin today with Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Scholz told reporters that he is withdrawing a key document needed for the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in response to Russia’s actions against Ukraine.
Scholz said “the situation today looks fundamentally different” and Berlin had to “reassess the situation with regards to Nord Stream 2″.
The gas pipeline project cannot go ahead now in these crisis circumstances, he added.
“That sounds technical, but it is the necessary administrative step so there can be no certification of the pipeline and without this certification, Nord Stream 2 cannot begin operating,” Scholz said.
He told the media that these are “difficult hours” for Europe and that new sanctions are needed to avoid a “disaster”.
He warned that a war may break out in Eastern Europe following Putin’s announcement yesterday, stating that the troops are there now, and that no one knows what could happen next.
Scholz said a robust reaction from Europe can be expected, stating that it is important to launch new sanctions.
“This is now about taking concrete steps,” he said.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the announcement by Russian President Putin yesterday that Russia was recognising the separatist regions in Ukraine “crosses a line”.
Speaking in a joint press conference with the German Chancellor this morning, Martin said “it is a flagrant violation of international law and a breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty”.
“It breaches the fundamental principles of the UN Charter, under which all members must refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
“As I have said, together with our EU partners, Ireland stands in solidarity with Ukraine. The Chancellor and I discussed the EU’s response –which will be robust.

“I again, call on Russia to de-escalate, and to withdraw its military forces from the Ukrainian border,” said the Taoiseach.
At the press conference, Chancellor Scholz said Russia’s actions breach international law and breaches all international agreements Russia has signed up to over the past 50 years.
Today, the Taoiseach will attend the Federal Chancellery in the German capital for a working lunch, following military honours on arrival and a private meeting between the two leaders.
Later in the day, the Taoiseach will visit Berlin’s Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe for a wreath-laying ceremony and a tour of the museum.
Speaking at the press conference today, Martin said:
“As we emerge from the pandemic, and as we drive forward with the green and digital transformations, we need to ensure that we take advantage of these new opportunities to deliver high-quality and high‑skilled jobs across the EU
“Our Governments share a high level of ambition on climate action, and we both support the EU’s climate goals for 2030 and beyond.”

He said he looked forward to discussing the EU’s relations with the UK.
“I am glad to have the opportunity to thank the Chancellor in person for Germany’s support and solidarity throughout the Brexit process.
“Ireland wants to see a strong and durable partnership between the EU and the UK in the future. For this to happen, existing agreements – including the Protocol – need to be implemented in good faith,” he added.
“I hope that the British Government will engage constructively with this work so that we can find pragmatic solutions to some of the issues that have arisen, within the framework of the Protocol.
“I will also take the opportunity to brief the Chancellor on the difficult political situation in Northern Ireland, and the importance of ensuring a period of calm ahead of the Assembly elections in May,” said the Taoiseach.
“Chancellor Scholz, may I again express my thanks for Germany’s enduring friendship, and for your warm welcome today,” he concluded.
Covid-19
Due to the Taoiseach being in Germany today, he will be unable to attend the weekly Cabinet meeting in Ireland, where ministers are due to sign off on the proposals to end  mandatory mask-wearing.

The Taoiseach confirmed last Friday that the Government would be accepting the guidance from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) that will bring an end to mandatory mask-wearing.
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has recommended an end to the mandatory wearing of masks, but they will be advisory in healthcare settings and on public transport.
The changes will come into place on 28 February, the Taoiseach confirmed over the weekend.
E-scooters
While the Taoiseach is in Berlin, a number of other items are due to be discussed by Cabinet today, such as as the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, which is being brought byMinister for Transport Eamon Ryan.
He is proposing a number of amendments to the Bill, which seeks to legislate for electricscooters and electric bikes.
Currently the proposed Bill makes it an offence to supply the scooters to people under the age of 16 – however, this is now set to be scrapped as it is thought such a measure would be unenforceable.
The minister is also understood to be proposing a number of other amendments to the Bill which deal with cycleways, the power the minister has to set regulations regarding variations in the alcohol breath tests, as well as transparency around NCT data.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is set to bring his consumer protection Bill, which seeks to give more powers to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Commission for Communications Regulation in a bid to challenge anti-competitive practices by business and to protect consumers.
While it had been expected that the Justice Minister Helen McEntee was to bring proposals to Cabinet this week for defamation law reform, it is now expected this won’t not happen until next week.
Minister of State for Heritage Malcolm Noonan will tomorrow brief his ministerial colleagues on a new cross-Government strategy for the protection, conservation, promotion and management of Ireland’s heritage for the next decade and beyond.
Heritage Ireland, which will be launched tomorrow, sets out a roadmap for the future for Irish heritage with a joined up approach at government, stakeholder and community levels.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he does not believe that former EU Commissioner Phil Hogan was treated like a “criminal” in the aftermath of Golfgate.
In an interview with the Irish Independent, Hogan said he was treated like a “criminal” stating that a media “mob” engulfed him during the controversy of the Oireachtas Golf Society event in 2020.
Hogan has also suggested that he may seek compensation from the European Commission over his resignation amid the Golfgate controversy.
Hogan resigned from the trade commissioner role in August 2020 after attending the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner and as revelations about his movements during severe pandemic restrictions emerged.
The resignation followed a demand from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to account for his time in Ireland around the society event.
When asked in Berlin if he agrees with Hogan’s comments that he was treated like a “criminal”, the Taoiseach responded: “I don’t believe so.”

“I think the issue that Phil raised is one between the European Commission.
“He’s paid a very heavy price for the situation at the time. He was a diligent and effective Commissioner.
“But as I said before, there was a context to that time as well, in terms of where the public were in terms of adherence to the guidance and the spirit of the Covid-19 guidance.
“Fundamentally, I haven’t read the interview but I heard feedback from it in terms of what has been articulated and fundamentally, it’s a matter between the Commission and Phil Hogan,” he said.
When asked if he or the Tánaiste will reflect on their actions as regards Hogan’s position and the controversy at the time, Martin said:
“I have reflected on that, I’ve been very clear from the beginning on that. I’ve never looked at this issue through the narrow prism of a legal channel or a court situation, rather looked at it from a broader situation of public trust.”
He said it was an “issue of trust” adding that the actions of Fianna Fáil TD Dara Calleary stepping down as minister at the time “actually did a lot to maintain that trust between government and the people”.

,"EU sanctions on Russia will not stop Ukraine invasion, says Taoiseach","A package of European Union sanctions on Russia agreed overnight will not stop the current invasion of Ukraine, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said. The 27 leaders agreed to slap sanctions on the Russian finance, energy, and transport sectors and impose asset freezes and travel bans on key figures associated with the regime, to be finalised by officials throughout Friday. But they stopped short of the hardest-hitting measures that had been called for by the Ukrainian government along with a phalanx of eastern European member states, with the support of Ireland. “People can argue one particular...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/eu-sanctions-on-russia-will-not-stop-ukraine-invasion-says-taoiseach-1.4811911?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-02-25T09:43:00+00:00,"The European Union is to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in fresh sanctions set to be agreed by the 27 today, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.
“I think both of those names will be added to a long list of other names,” Mr Coveney said as he arrived for an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers to hash out further sanctions.
“I think that’s the right thing to do because they are the key decision makers in terms of what’s happened.”
He warned that he believed Russia to be perpetrating war crimes in Ukraine, after the Kyiv government accused Moscow of bombing hospitals.
“I have no doubt that war crimes are currently being committed in Ukraine as we speak,” Mr Coveney told journalists.
EU leaders gave their political backing to sanctions hitting Russian energy, transport, financial services and imports overnight, with officials working to formalise the legal text on Friday.
There are expected to be some controversial carve outs to the sanctions, such as excluding the diamond trade and luxury goods.
The big-hitting measures of freezing energy imports and booting Russia from the international financial payments system Swift were also put on ice after major European countries including Germany and Italy are said to have opposed the move.
But the EU is now preparing yet another fresh round of sanctions, in which Russia’s exclusion from the Swift system could still go ahead, Mr Coveney said.
“I understand that there is already a third package of sanctions that includes the Swift system, which may well be passed in the next few days,” the foreign minister said.
“This is a big package. Yes, we want to add to it. Ireland wanted to go further. And I think we’ll end up going further.”
“I’ve been in politics for nearly 25 years. I’ve never seen anything that has galvanised the European Union in the way that this has, in terms of the sense of unity, the sense of urgency, the need to respond,” he added
Earlier, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said a package of European Union sanctions on Russia agreed overnight will not stop the current invasion of Ukraine.
The 27 leaders agreed to slap sanctions on the Russian finance, energy, and transport sectors and impose asset freezes and travel bans on key figures associated with the regime, to be finalised by officials throughout Friday.
But they stopped short of the hardest-hitting measures that had been called for by the Ukrainian government along with a phalanx of eastern European member states, with the support of Ireland.
“People can argue one particular type of sanction versus another but in its totality, what was decided last evening, is very strong,” the Taoiseach told journalists.
“On its own, it’s not going to stop what has been a deliberate, premeditated decision of President Putin to launch this brutal attack on the Ukrainian people. To attain some sort of historic ideal he has in his head about restoration of empire, harking back to a bygone era.”
He described the sanctions as “the largest and most severe ever adopted” that would “hit hard” over the medium term.
“It’s a very comprehensive range of measures, covering finance, covering industry, covering trade, energy, and transport, and they will have impact. They will not stop Russia now.”
“There will be a price to be paid for this,” by EU economies and citizens, he added. “This is going to be a long haul.”
Meanwhile, Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne has said Ireland’s solidarity is with Ukraine and that this does not affect neutrality.
He said: “Ukraine wants to be democratic, it wants to set its own destiny. We support that. It shouldn’t be bullied by anybody. It will make its own decisions.”
He said Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney was in Brussels for talks with his European and US counterparts on the situation.
“We do not want war in Europe. I think that would be absolutely disastrous,” he said: “The Ukrainian army is very, very strong.
“The Ukrainian people are very, very proud and I don’t think they’re going to allow Russia simply just to roll in the tanks and take over.
“They’re getting military support from other countries.”
Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba appealed for international leaders to block Russia from the Swift international payments system as the European Council met. To those opposed to the move, he said ""the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands"".
But major European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Hungary opposed the move, which would cause deep complications for states that need the system to make payments to Russia for its gas and oil supplies on which they rely.
The EU also stopped short of cutting off imports of Russian gas and oil outright, which would be likely to exacerbate high prices and a tight supply.
Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki tore into such payments for fossil fuels as a funnel of money to the Russian regime to fund its war chest.
“President Putin is taking the money from us, from the Europeans, and he is turning this into aggression, invasion, he is destabilising the whole of Europe,” Mr Morawiecki said.
Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk, who heads the EU’s largest pan-European political group, said that “those EU governments, which blocked tough decisions... Germany, Hungary, Italy, have disgraced themselves”.
Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy joined the gathering of the 27 leaders remotely, and said he had appealed for them to give his country a pathway to Nato membership, before vowing to remain in Kyiv even as a top target for assassination as Russian forces close in.
“Today, I asked the 27 leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in Nato. I asked directly. Everyone is afraid. They do not answer,” Mr Zelenskiy said in a statement.
“We are not afraid of anything. We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia.”
The Taoiseach said that EU leaders had reckoned with the reality of the limits of what they could do.
“I think there’s a fundamental vulnerability that democracies have. We think rational, we think balanced. We always pursued a diplomatic track,” Mr Martin said.
“We believe in the UN Charter, president Putin doesn’t,” he continued. “But the irrational, unacceptable and unjustifiable behaviour of president Putin, I don’t see as a failure of democracies. Rather, I see it really as the fault of an authoritarian leader who is captivated by some ideology that harks back to the days of empire, which we cannot accept.”

The Cabinet on Tuesday approved the programme for this year's Decade of Centenaries events which will be announced by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Minister for Culture Catherine Martin and Mr Varadkar at a later date.
The Civil War - which claimed more than 1,000 lives - broke out in the summer of 1922 between forces that supported or opposed the Treaty that ended the War of Independence but left six counties under British control.
Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil grew out of the political parties that took opposing sides in the war, with Fine Gael's forerunners supporting the Treaty and Fianna Fáil's opposing it.
Mr Varadkar, the Fine Gael leader, said there was an event earlier this year to mark the centenary of the handover of Dublin Castle by the British and there will be one towards the end of the year to remember the foundation of the Free State, which he said is “very much associated with my party”.
He said a date for an event remembering all those who fought and died in the Civil War was yet to be determined, but that it would be held on a “neutral date”.
Mr Varadkar said the event is designed to be inclusive and commemorative, “one that is authentic to our history, but one that doesn’t seek to challenge or undermine anyone’s loyalties”. He also said there will be academic events and conferences on the subject of the Civil War.
Mr Varadkar said the 2022 programme of events for the Decade of Centenaries is “quite exciting” and a budget has been allocated to it.

A matter of hours after bitter exchanges in the Dáil with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, Mr Martin returned to the theme of his own upbringing being difficult and modest compared to leading opposition members such as Ms McDonald and party housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin (both of whom were privately educated).
Speaking at a press conference on the Housing for All Strategy, Mr Martin said: “There has been a very deliberate attempt by Sinn Féin to create a particular political narrative, in my view, a fraudulent narrative. that members of the Government party are some elite upper class cabal who don’t understand the need for housing on the ground.
“The language is part of a ruthless narrative which has been deployed by Sinn Féin for quite some time. To be honest with you when I look across at the likes of Deputy Ó Broin and others, it’s a bit rich for them to be lecturing me in terms of my background.”
He denied he was engaging in reverse class prejudice by singling out two beneficiaries of private education. “People of different backgrounds can come forward and make a good contribution to public life but stop lecturing as if you are the working class hero on the other side, while everybody else on the Government side is unfeeling, has no connection with reality and has no commitment for housing provision,” he said.
Speaking immediately afterwards Mr Ó Broin denied the claim and accused Mr Martin of being more out of touch than any other taoiseach in recent times.
“I am not saying this to personalise it but rents are higher now than they have been at any time. House prices will surpass (record levels).”
“Homelessness is beginning to rise again… It did not meet affordable or social housing targets last year… Micheál Martin is taking the public for fools.”
Mr Martin was speaking at the latest quarterly report for the €20 billion housing plan, launched by Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien last year. Mr O’Brien, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan were also in attendance.
The Ministers said that 123 of the 213 actions in the plan had been completed or were being delivered. Mr O’Brien said that construction had commenced on 30,000 homes in 2021, the highest since 2008, and representing a three-fold increase since 2015.
Mr O’Brien and Mr Varadkar referred to a “pipeline” of 40,000 new planning permissions and a substantial increase in the number of young people taking up apprenticeships in construction.
Mr Ryan said a feasibility study will be carried out on Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines to determine its suitability for social and affordable homes. Mr Ryan claimed the site could potentially deliver 1,000 new homes close to the city centre.
Mr O’Brien also said that the Land Development Agency (LDA) had commenced Project Tosaigh, which will accelerate work on private developments with over 150 homes, which have planning permission but have been stalled for one reason or another.
Mr Varadkar also said the LDA would be as important to the State in future as the ESB has been for energy and the IDA for investment.
The Housing For All plan will require €4 billion of State funding each year, said the Taoiseach, but that would be supplemented by further €10 billion in private investment. Both he and Mr Varadkar argued that private investment was key, with the Tánaiste saying that home ownership was vital.
“Owning your home is part of our culture… as it gives financial security and roots us in our community.”
The Taoiseach admitted that Covid-19 has had an impact and there were supply-chain difficulties as well as inflationary pressures on the cost of housing. Mr Varadkar and he also accepted that all goals had been reached.
For his part, Mr O’Brien pointed to the fact that 43,500 mortgages had been drawn down in 2021 as a sign that housing development was gaining momentum.
He said that almost 1,600 cost rental houses would be built in 2022 and said the Government would meet its target of supplying 9,000 affordable homes in 2022 and 10,000 social homes. He also claimed that affordable homes would be built at greater scale in the coming year.
Mr O’Brien accepted that homeless figures remained high and said it was a “major concern” for the Government.

Minister for Justice Helen McEntee confirmed that the move, flagged by Taoiseach Micheál Martin on the opening day of the conflict, has now taken place.
Among its aims is to streamline and support the swift exit of both the Ukrainian family members of Irish citizens, and the family members of people from Ukraine who are resident in Ireland.
The Department of Justice said it will apply as an emergency measure to all Ukrainians travelling to Ireland.
The Statutory Instrument removing the visa requirement for Ukraine nationals takes immediate effect.
Those who travel to Ireland without a visa will then have 90 days after arrival to regularise their position.
The Department said this position will be kept under ongoing review with the impact monitored closely.
Ms McEntee said: ""I am appalled by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the aggressive attack against a democratic sovereign state in Europe.
""We stand in solidarity with Ukraine and its people and will, working with our partners in the European Union, play our part in assisting them in their time of need.
“That is why I am immediately lifting visa requirements between Ukraine and Ireland.”
She also said that the Government will also work with colleagues “on any further EU-wide measures that might assist those fleeing Ukraine.”

Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other party leaders were informed by senior officials earlier this week that a hybrid or accredited grades model – based on teachers' estimates – might need to draw on schools' historical results in the Junior Cert exams.
This is due to the absence of exam data for about 25 per cent of this year’s Leaving Cert candidates, who did not sit the Junior Cert in 2020 when it was cancelled due to Covid-19 concerns.
This data is regarded as crucial in the standardisation process, which aims to ensure teachers’ estimated grades in different schools are equitably awarded.
However, Government sources said the use of this data has now been ruled out in the event that some form of accredited grades is used because it could prove to be as “too problematic”.
A decision on the format of this year’s Leaving Cert is likely in the next week or so.
The Government had planned to use school profiling in 2020 when Leaving Cert exams were first replaced by a system based on teachers’ estimates.
However, it dropped the plan following opposition claims this could penalise students attending school in disadvantaged areas.
Officials are now understood to be examining whether it is possible to generate accredited grades in a different way that is fair and equitable.
One Government source said it was their understanding that Leaving Cert options have now narrowed. “It seems to be edging towards traditional exams this year, with greater choice for students,” they said.
While additional choice in questions in the forthcoming State exams were announced last August, officials have been exploring ways of going further due to the level of Covid-related disruption which has occurred since.
This could see a similar level of choice incorporated into the summer exams as was used last year.
Another Government source said all options were still being considered and nothing had been ruled out. “Things are still at a delicate stage,” they said.
Students are calling for the introduction of a hybrid Leaving Cert on the basis that many have experienced significant disruption to their studies due to the pandemic.
Teachers’ unions are opposed to grading their students for the purposes of the Leaving Cert and say further adjustments to the exams are needed.
It is understood Mr Martin, along with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, were briefed on potential options for the format of this year's exam on Monday by Minister for Education Norma Foley and her officials.
The decision to omit school profiling in the 2020 Leaving Cert was at the centre of an legal challenge taken by Belvedere College student Freddie Sherry, who argued that the decision impacted unfairly on his results.
However, the High Court ruled that the Government was fully entitled to make changes to the standardisation model which they considered to be in the public interest.
It found that Mr Sherry had not shown he, or Belvedere, were subject of an unfairness arising from the final approach taken and had ""certainly not"" established an unfairness that would lead the court to conclude the system was unlawful.

Martin-Richmond, a 59-year-old separated mother of two grown-up children, is a sister of Taoiseach Micheál Martin and says her family’s working-class roots keep her grounded.
She takes after her late father, Paddy, who worked as a bus driver for CIÉ and was a dogged saver who worked as much overtime as he could get. Paddy, known as “the champ” because of his boxing prowess, managed to fulfil his dream of owning a holiday house in Galley Head, west Cork. (He bought it during the recession-hit 1980s for about £21,000). The five Martin siblings each have a share in it now.
While owning a holiday house in West Cork is very much a status symbol for Cork’s upper middle classes (the Taoiseach has a holiday home in Courtmacsherry on the coast), Paddy Martin was far from middle class. He would have agreed with his son’s defence of his working-class credentials when he rounded this week on Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who accused the Taoiseach of being out of touch regarding the struggles of working people. The Taoiseach said that McDonald “sets out a narrative that I am divorced from reality. What I had to put up with coming from my background and where I grew up was far different from what she had to put up with.”
As Cllr Seán Martin, the eldest of the Martin siblings, said to The Irish Times, he has heard the so-called “well-heeled” description of his brother before.
“He certainly wasn’t well got. It’s nonsense. I think Micheál epitomises what people have achieved in this country. We had a terraced house in O’Connell Avenue with three bedrooms.” The local authority-built house was purchased on a rent-to-buy basis. “We had a happy childhood. We had a solid working-class background. My father was heavily into education.”
Proving this, Mairéad, who bought out the family house in 2013, shows off the encyclopaedias her father and mother invested in for the household as well as books published by the Oxford Press including Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. (Mairéad’s sister Eileen O’Mahony is a secondary school teacher in Carrigtwohill.)
While McDonald’s beef with the Taoiseach was over “Generation Rent”, Mairéad admits that housing in her area “is definitely an issue and it has been for years. Micheál wouldn’t deny that. I would have people coming to my house asking if there’s any possibility that something could be done for them.”
When Mairéad got her first job at the age of 17, she joined the credit union and took out a small insurance policy.
“People were laughing at me,” she said.
She clearly was an old head on young shoulders. But she had the example of her father to guide her. And it has served her well. She grew up with the daughters and sons of men who worked in Ford and Dunlop as well as CIÉ and the post office. She also knew people in the vicinity who lived in overcrowded tenements.
Mairéad, who like so many of her generation had to emigrate in the 1980s (to Holland in her case), says her father “never let us forget about his own background”.
“He was from a deprived area on the north side of Cork and had a tough upbringing. But they got on with it,” she said.
The Martin house on O’Connell Avenue didn’t have a bathroom until Mairéad was 14. Up until then, the family had to make do with a toilet at the bottom of the stairs. “There was a big tin bath in the kitchen where we washed on Saturday night. You’d dry your hair in front of the old fireplace.”
The sittingroom in Mairéad’s house has a big, soft red leather suite of furniture and the Christmas tree, shorn of its decorations, is still up, waiting to be taken away.
Over breakfast in the Beer Garden, a popular pub on Evergreen Street (which oddly enough still has Christmas decorations up in late January), Robert Boyle (79) says he has no time for the Taoiseach and agrees with McDonald that he is “out of touch”.
He wonders why with Government heavy hitters in his constituency, such as Micheál Martin, Simon Coveney and Michael McGrath, more isn’t being done for local people. Boyle complains that his son-in-law’s weekly diesel bill has gone up by €20. He drives to work from Cork to Killarney where he works as a fabricator.
Boyle says that the Martin family “have done well”.
“People had it a lot tougher [than the Taoiseach’s family]. I originated from the middle parish (close to Cork city centre) and saw tough times there. I saw houses with four, five and six families living in them. When we moved to Togher [close to Ballyphehane which adjoins Turner’s Cross] it was like going to a hotel compared to what we were used to,” he said.
“Turner’s Cross at that time [the 1940s] was an uppish place.”
Green Party councillor Dan Boyle was two years below Micheál Martin at Coláiste Chríost Rí.
“We were altar boys together at Christ the King church,” he said.
They also played football together in Nemo Rangers. Cllr Boyle says that, growing up in Ireland in the 1970s, the culture “was not aspirational”.
“I’d describe Turner’s Cross as a kind of classless society. It’s an area where people have always felt comfortable. It never developed the kind of social problems you’d see in other communities. But there was never any great public investment in it other than the building of houses,” he said.
As far as unemployed Laurence Marshall (55) from O’Connell Crescent is concerned, Micheál Martin is “more of a politician than Mary Lou”.
“She says what’s on her mind. He says what you want him to say,” he said.
Marshall has been living in Turner’s Cross for 22 years, having originally lived in Ballyphehane.
“I don’t know what life was like for Micheál growing up here. But it’s not Montenotte,” he adds.

The Dáil yesterday heard a report into the June 2020 gathering, compiled by a senior civil servant and published on Monday, described as a “whitewash” and there were fresh demands for an independent investigation into the incident.
However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected the criticisms and said that Sinn Féin's position on the matter was ""hypocritical"" as it had been involved in the funeral of Bobby Storey a few weeks after the department drinks, which saw large numbers gather to mark the death of the Belfast republican.
Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty said Mr Martin should have Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney come before the Dáil to answer questions on the incident. People Before Profit-Solidarity's Paul Murphy called the report ""a whitewash from start to finish"".
The report, compiled by the now department secretary-general Joe Hackett, found ""a breach of social distance guidance occurred"" when staff came together to celebrate Ireland's election to the UN body.
It said there was no breaking of statutory rules but “a serious breach of social distancing guidance”. Four senior officials have agreed to make contributions to charities doing Covid-19 related work as a result.
Mr Doherty said the review had not interviewed Mr Coveney, as it was outside the terms of reference, adding that the terms had been drafted by the Minister. He said this was typical of a Minister who was “out of touch, at the helm for too long” and whose judgment was regularly being questioned.
In response, Mr Martin said he was not in government at the time but the gathering was “wrong, should not have happened and those who were involved have apologised”. He said he was “genuinely taken back” by Mr Doherty’s tone.
“You are the deputy leader of a party that invited almost 2,000 members and supporters onto the streets of Belfast and then for a political rally, essentially, in a cemetery at a time when ordinary men and women that you speak about were limited… to 30 people at a funeral…Ordinary men and women you talk about were distraught because they couldn’t attend the funeral of their loved ones,” he said.
“Everybody with eyes in their head could see what happened and it’s only weeks after the event that you’re raising such a huge issue around.
“To the best of my knowledge you or your organisation has never admitted that you were in the wrong in what you did, but you lecture everybody else.”
An Garda Síochána said it would not be investigating the event due to the statute of limitations as it had taken place more than a year ago.
Under the Health Act 1947, breaches of Covid-19 regulations are summary matters meaning they have a six-month statute of limitations.
Even if a Garda investigation was possible, it is unclear what it would examine, based on Monday’s report. Social distancing guidelines do not have a legislative basis and breaches are not criminal offences.
“An Garda Síochána had/has no role in the enforcement of Public Health Guidelines,” a spokesman said.

“I do intend to bring to Cabinet shortly proposals for a citizens’ assembly on biodiversity,” Mr Martin said.
“I think it’s absolutely critical that we move on this and move with speed and conviction, and I intend to do that.”
Mr O'Sullivan said Ireland needed to act now and convene a Citizens' Assembly ""because we need to start addressing this biodiversity crisis now"".
The Cork South-West TD highlighted the loss of 81 per cent of Ireland’s wetland species over the past 50 years.
He said 54 individual bird species had been red listed, meaning they are endangered.

THE TAOISEACH HAS told Fianna Fáil TDs that price fixing and profiteering is “completely unacceptable” and “a barbaric act of cruelty on a civil population”.
The comments came ahead of a Governmentcut to excise duty on petrol and dieselthat is to take effect from tomorrow and last until 31 August. The cut will result in a 20c per litre drop on petrol, 15c per litre drop on diesel and 2c drop on marked gas oil.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said that filling a 60-litre tank should therefore reduce by an of €12 for petrol and €9 for diesel.
Despite this measure, there have been photos shared on social media of the high cost of petrol and diesel per litre, with many claiming that the cost increased dramatically overnight – sometimes, seemingly by the amount that the Government aimed to reduce costs by.
At the weekend,senior sources confirmedtoThe Journalthat the Government would move to cut excise within the week as the price hit €2 per litre mark for petrol and diesel at some service stations.
Amid these reports, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said at a parliamentary party meeting tonight that “any exploitation of a barbaric war such as this is morally reprehensible” and that “such profiteering is completely unacceptable on fuel prices”.

Many people have been sharing sudden spikes in the cost of petrol per litre, seemingly overnight – with some people noting that the overnight increase is exactly the amount that the Government is aiming to cut petrol and diesel costs by.
People-Before-Profit/Solidarity TD Paul Murphy told the Dáiltodaythat a petrol station around the corner from where he lives increased the price of diesel by 15c at lunchtime today, and called for price controls.
Ahead of a Dáil vote being held tonight to approve the Government’s cut on excise on fuel and diesel, Fianna Fáil TD for Dún Laoghaire Cormac Devlinsaidthat authorities must investigate reports of price gouging and “take action” against those companies.
Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore told the Dáil this evening that she had written to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to ask that it investigate reports of “cartel behaviour and price fixing” by motor fuel suppliers.
Earlier today, AA Ireland welcomed the excise cut but encouraged service stations not to increase prices to take advantage of the tax reduction.
“We would hope that the service stations would play ball. We have no control over that. We can only encourage them to do so,” AA Ireland’s head of communications toldThe Journal.

Mr Martin said price increases on energy and food would continue until the end of the year and that the Government could not bring in separate measures to help households ""every single week"".
Speaking during Leader's Questions in the Dáil on Tuesday, Mr Martin said the Republic had sought a derogation from European Commission rules so that VAT can be lowered on fuels.
He was responding to Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who said workers and families face a cost of living crisis that “demands an urgent response”.
Ms McDonald said last week Energia was the third energy supplier this year to announce a price increase, while there were 35 energy price hikes in 2020.
“Without action, low- and middle-income households face an income squeeze that they will struggle to withstand and indeed many are already unable to cope,” she said.
Mr Martin said there was “no doubt” a very severe increase had occurred in the cost of living over the last number of months, and particularly as the State emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic.
He said the war in Ukraine was “significantly adding and making far worse” the inflationary pressures on the economy, particularly on households, with energy, food and other commodities affected.
""At the moment Russia and Ukraine account for about 30 per cent of global exports of wheat, 7 per cent of maize and more than 50 per cent of sunflower seed oil,"" said Mr Martin.
""Together they produce 12 per cent of calories consumed globally and Ukraine supplies about a quarter of the European Union cereal and vegetable oil imports. So there's going to be ongoing impacts from this war over and above what we've already witnessed to date.""
Mr Martin said existing transport routes had been disrupted because of the war and the cost of trade would increase.
He described price increases as “dramatic” and “phenomenal” and that the Government had provided close to €2 billion in income supports and targeted measures since the last budget.
Mr Martin said the Government couldn’t bring in separate measures and that they had to plan and prepare for the medium term.
Ms McDonald called for VAT to be removed on fuels for a “defined period” as well as the removal of excise duty from home heating oil.

The comments were contained in a transcript of Mr Zelenskiy’s speech, which was released overnight by the Ukrainian government.
Mr Zelenskiy appeared to single out Ireland as a country that ""almost"" stands with Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion, in an address to European Union leaders at the Brussels summit.
The Ukrainian leader spoke to the 27 leaders over video call from Kyiv and thanked member states one by one for standing with Ukraine, in particular eastern and Baltic allies, saying ""Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us.""
But Ireland was among the member states he appeared to describe as not offering full support. “Ireland – well, almost,” Mr Zelenskiy said, according to a translation of his remarks released by the Kyiv government early on Friday.
Micheál Martin spoke to reporters as he entered the summit venue for the second day of the meeting. “That wouldn’t have been my read of it. He was actually talking in terms of the European perspective ... I wouldn’t have taken the same slant that some may be taking from it.”
Last night, speaking after the summit had concluded, Mr Martin again played down the Ukrainian president's remarks, saying Mr Zelenskiy was fully aware of Ireland's contributions to his country and grateful for them.
“I think it’s been overstated, to be frank,” Mr Martin said.
Mr Martin said he spoke to Mr Zelenskiy last week when he was in Washington and he had “a very comprehensive oversight of Ireland’s contributions, both in terms of even the 20 million humanitarian aid in terms of the peace facility, and also in terms of the humanitarian response”.
He said that Mr Zelenskiy had “thanked me personally for our support of the Ukrainian European perspective”.
Mr Martin said he had been “really strong in relation to supporting Ukraine’s membership of the European Union. I’ve consistently said this, and would be supportive of Lithuania and others, and I’ve argued that the whole application process is too slow.”
“And obviously, I mean, one can surmise on one word, and I think we can over-interpret that as well, to be fair, because you know, our contact with the embassy of Ukraine in Dublin has been pretty clear,” Mr Martin said.
The Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs on Friday evening publicly thanked Ireland for joining the The Group of Friends of Accountability, an informal forum of countries expressing an intent to ensure that international crimes perpetrated since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia a month ago be punished.
Welcoming the move, Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said his government was ""grateful to our Irish partners for joining the Group of Friends of Accountability today. Undoubtedly, Ireland is at the forefront within the EU and beyond providing essential support for Ukraine in all possible ways.""
Ireland also moved early to waive visas for Ukrainians before the EU moved as a whole and has sent humanitarian aid, with the Government repeatedly expressing full solidarity with the country.
However, Mr Zelenskiy’s remarks may refer to Ireland’s decision not to send military aid to the country. The Government opted to send medical and humanitarian supplies alone, staying out of a joint €1 billion fund for arms for Ukraine supported by almost all other EU countries.
The official Ukrainian transcript of Mr Zelenskiy's speech translated the words as ""well, almost"". However, the simultaneous translation while Mr Zelenskiy was speaking to the European Council translated as ""well, practically"". This was referenced by the Taoiseach this morning when questioned on the issue. However, a Ukrainian speaker consulted by The Irish Times said the best translation was ""well, almost"" and that the sense of Mr Zelenskiy's remarks was that Irish support for Ukraine was less vigorous than other countries.

IrishCentral Staff,"""Sinister,"" ""shocking,"" ""trash"" - Irish politicians respond to Russian nuclear wipeout simulation","Taoiseach Micheál Martin says an ""apology should be forthcoming"" after Russian state TV aired a simulation showing Ireland being wiped out by a Russian nuclear weapon.",https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/irish-russian-nuclear-simulation,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-05-04T09:20:32+00:00,"Leading Irish politicians have responded to the shocking simulation aired on Russian state TV over the weekend that showedIreland being obliterated by a nuclear weapon.
“It is very sinister intimidatory type tactics by the Russian Federation but I don’t think anyone is going to be intimidated by it,"" Taoiseach Micheál Martin told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the Russian state TV simulation that aired over the weekend.
“I think it reflects a mindset that is worrying and not in touch with reality. I think there should be an apology forthcoming in relation to that.
“But the more fundamental point, I think, is that Russia should cease their hostilities in Ukraine.
“The degree of bombardment and destruction of towns and cities and human carnage that has taken place is absolutely without justification.
“It is an immoral war that should end and humanitarian corridors should be provided consistently, particularly for those trapped in Mariupol and in other locations.”
Over the weekend, clips of a Russian state TV news broadcast began to circulate on Twitter with English subtitles. The broadcast featured simulations of weaponry targeted at the UK that obliterates Ireland.
""The island is so small that just one Sarmat missile is sufficient to sink it once and for all,"" host Dmitry Kiselyov chillingly says in the clip, ""Everything's been calculated already.""
It's Sunday night in Russia which means that state TV's Dmitry Kiselyov is talking about Russia using its nukes
This time, with the help of a terrifying cartoon, he claims that ""one Sarmat missile is enough to sink the British Isles"" (with subs)pic.twitter.com/NqbQfkm6rX


The simulation shows the Russian ""unmanned underwater vehicle Poseidon"" striking off the coast of Co Donegal in the northwest of Ireland, ultimately wiping out Ireland and the UK.

Speaking withNewstalkon Tuesday, Eamon Ryan, Ireland's Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, slammed the Russian simulation as ""shocking.""
He said: ""It's replicated right across Europe where people are looking on thinking, what will happen next?
""There's a lot of concerns that on May the 9, which is victory day celebrating the end of World War II in eastern Europe, that that could be a point to mobilization or a further stepping up of the warmongering.
""I think that's a risk to us, that's a risk to every other European country, and beyond, because what's happening in this war is putting up food prices and energy prices, that also hits the poorest countries in the world.
""It isn't just bombs that kill people, it will be famine and the escalation in energy prices have an immediate effect on people.""
When asked if the Russian Ambassador to Ireland should be sanctioned because of the simulation, Ryan said: ""One of the arguments is whether we should have or not retain our embassy in Moscow. I've always said it is better to retain it.
""I believe it was state television that that clip was used on? It is totally unacceptable and I'm quite sure our diplomats in Moscow and our Department of Foreign Affairs here will be making it known.""
Ireland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney slammed the Russian simulation as “trash"" on Tuesday.
“Let’s not allow ourselves be distracted from the real atrocities being committed by Russian Forces in #Ukraine by disinformation like this,” Coveney tweeted.

THE GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE to the climate emergency has been characterised by delay and inadequacy, new Labour leader Ivana Bacik has said.
During Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil, Bacik describeda UN report into climate changeas “chilling” and challenged Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Ireland’s reliance on imported gas.
Martin said that all parties needed to work together to tackle emissions and described the UN report was a “stark warning to all governments”.
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this week warned that immediate action is needed to curb dangerous climate change and called for an end to the fossil fuel age.
Referring to the report, Bacik said: “Time is running out to save our planet and to ensure the future of humanity.

“Indeed by a failure to address the clear interconnection between the climate crisis, the energy security crisis exacerbated by the horrific war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis that is biting so deep into so many households across our communities.”
She added: “I raised with you last week concerns that we have about over reliance on imported gas, because this will only worsen if we proceed to build eight new gas-fired electricity plants by 2024.
“Particularly when we have no clarity as to where the gas to power them will come from.
“If we don’t take these urgent actions we know from the IPCC that the consequences will be catastrophic, and that the chance to avoid the worst impact of the climate crisis will be lost.
“This is an immediate and critical issue for us here in Ireland.”
The Labour leader continued: “So I’m asking if you can confirm the establishment immediately of a Just Transition Commission to manage our transition to a decarbonised future, which does not adversely impact on those who are most severely affected by the cost of living crisis and the energy security crisis and indeed, by the enormous hikes we’ve seen in energy bills for so many in recent in recent weeks.”
Martin said: “Yesterday’s IPCC report is a stark warning to all governments and to all parliaments about the impossibility of putting this to one side, of deferring action.

“We need honest debate about these things and not always falling back to what’s politically convenient in the short term because short term political convenience will not save the planet.
“If we’re sincere about climate change, and I’m open to working with all parties in the house on climate change, because it is existential, then the least we can do as a parliament is to make sure that the generations coming after us, that we give them some chance, some chance of a quality of life, because what awaits them is truly horrendous if we keep on in denial.”
The Taoiseach added: “Now in respect of the Just Transition Commission, yes, we will be establishing a Just Transition Commission.
“Minister Eamon Ryan is extending the current Just Transmission Commissioner Kieran Mulvey to the end of the year and the full commission will be established.”

“THE SPECTRE OF famine” still haunts millions of people worldwide, 175 years after Ireland’s Great Hunger, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.
Speaking at the annual Famine Commemoration Ceremony in Strokestown Park, Co. Roscommon, the Taoiseach noted Ireland’s “bitter past” has spurred it to send “not just thoughts and prayers, but money, expertise and most importantly our people, be they missionaries, peacekeepers or the staff of our many NGOs to assist those experiencing the darkest of times”.
The state ceremony included military honours and a wreath laying ceremony by ambassadors to Ireland.
He drew comparisons between Ireland’s Great Famine and the Holodomor in Soviet Ukraine in 1932-33, which is estimated to have killed up to 10 million people.
“Through our participation in International bodies, such as the United Nations, we have sought to raise our voice in defence of the victims,” Martin said. “And of course, we are steadfast in our solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against a brutal and unjust war waged against them by a neo-imperial power.
“One of the many reasons why the people of Ukraine prize their freedom so dearly is that they too bear deep scars from a famine which destroyed millions of lives. The Holodomor of 1932-33 was a crime against humanity – a famine imposed on what is one of the largest food producing countries in the world.
“When the people of Ukraine voted for independence they did so in a spirit of self-reliance and without rancour.  They chose for themselves a simple flag of a clear sky over fields of wheat.

As war rages in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned his country risks triggering global food shortages, adding that the situation in Ukraine’s Donbas is “very difficult”.
Russia, which invaded Ukraine on 24 February, has increasingly turned its attention to the country’s east since the end of March, after failing to take the capital Kyiv.
Western analysts believe President Vladimir Putin has his sights on annexing southern and eastern Ukraine in the months ahead but his troops have appeared to be encountering stiff resistance.
Minister of State for the Gaeltacht Jack Chambers also spoke at the event.

Martin pointed to other modern food shortages, such as some six million people in Somalia who are affected by food insecurity.
“Just as in the 1840’s, the effects of drought are exacerbated by human action and inaction. Politics and ideology once again combine to increase the suffering of the poorest among us.”
He noted the groups who sent aid starving Irish people: “The doctors, the clergy, the Quaker community, and further afield, the members of groups such as the British Relief Association, the Choctaw Nation, the Jewish Community of New York, the Coloured Citizens of Philadelphia and the people of Toronto and countless others who opened their hearts.
“If we are to honour the victims of our Great Famine, if we are to be true to the spirit of trying to rid the curse of famine from our world, then we must be resolute in standing for cooperation between nations on the basis of humanitarian and democratic values.”

But he was also seen as a very cautious department head with a penchant for deferring tough decisions by forever commissioning reports and setting up committees.
Now that he has finally made it to the Taoiseach’s office, he seems determined to banish that reputation for indecisiveness once and for all. He hasn’t much time to do it.
Unlike the ownership arrangement he is championing for the new National Maternity Hospital, Micheál occupies the most desirable office in Government Buildings on a very short lease and will be out on his ear by December in accordance with the terms of his watertight agreement with Leo Varadkar.
At this point, no matter how much he might hope otherwise, the Fine Gael leader will reimpose a Fine Gael ethos on the Cabinet, making all major decisions on a politically appropriate basis. The thought of this upsets a lot of people. The unsettling De Valera and Lemass iconography will no sooner be down off the walls before Leo and his lot will have statues and portraits of Collins and Davitt littering the place.
So, not much more than six months to cement a legacy. Micheál Martin wants to get this long-awaited hospital project under way immediately. He has no doubt that it is fit for purpose and legally bullet-proof. He will broach no more objections.
The hospital will be built according to his Government’s plan. The Taoiseach was in no mood to entertain Opposition questions on Tuesday, declaring they had been more than answered in the past week.
Across the floor, Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats and Labour were still pointing up faults in his “watertight” deal but Micheál didn’t want to argue with Mary Lou McDonald, Róisín Shortall and Ivana Bacik. Then he accused Independent TD Thomas Pringle of trying to change the goalposts in the argument.
Mary Lou told him his decision to proceed with the project was wrong.
“You’re wrong,” he told her.
Róisín dismissed as “a charade” his promise two weeks ago to put the proposed deal up for discussion and keep an open mind on suggested changes. Nothing more than a sham, she said.
“Well, I’m clear in my conscience,” he retorted. “As Taoiseach, I’m not prepared to prevaricate. I’m not prepared to allow this to go on for another couple of years with no decision taken. I know how these things can get dragged on and dragged on for a variety of reasons.”
He sure does.
“I am determined that we move on and build modern, proper facilities for women in the 21st century.”
Ivana loftily informed him of “how disappointed” the Labour Party feels over his decision to press ahead and “how much we deplore the Cabinet decision”. That must have cut like a knife.
“What are you deploring?” griped the Taoiseach, getting rattier by the minute with all these niggling questions, which he insisted had been more than comprehensively answered, and then some.
“The ownership issue.”
What more could Micheál say to convince people that the State would own the hospital and, effectively, the land under it? How many more times did he have to utter the magic phrase?
How long is a long lease?
“Three hundred years at a tenner a week!” he cried once more (he meant a year). And that in his book, and in the opinion of the Attorney General and a whole legion of legal experts in the area of water-repellent contracts, amounts to ownership.
He was starting to sound like a political version of the Penneys humblebrag.
“That’s a fabulous looking maternity hospital, Taoiseach.”
“Oh, thanks very much. St Vincent’s Healthcare Group. Only a tenner for 300 years.”
But for all his protestations that the deal is not going to allow religious influence over clinical practice and the SVHG is not going to stiff the State for a fortune in the foreseeable centuries, the Opposition remains sceptical.
“It’s a publicly owned hospital,” he stressed for the umpteenth occasion, this time to Thomas Pringle. Shortall, in the next seat, was shaking her head. She likes nothing about this deal.
“Time will prove this,” sighed Micheál, thoroughly exasperated.
Thomas further irritated him by bringing up the highly contentious “clinically appropriate” phrase, which is in the agreement. Why not simply get rid of it and that would solve everything.
“Why are you so hung up on it when everybody agrees that if those two words were removed from the lease it actually would be acceptable?”
The Taoiseach was at the end of his tether. “For the last two weeks I’ve been arguing about ownership,” and now that issue has disappeared. “This keeps shifting and the goalposts keep changing.”
It was strange that he didn’t take the opportunity to point out that the Cabinet had agreed just a few hours earlier to draft a clarification to the phrase in response to the very negative public and political reaction. But he said nothing, allowing the line to stay out there that the Government was refusing to budge on it for some mysterious and possibly dangerous reason.
Could it be that Micheál is so invested in this deal, so convinced of its utter perfection that he just couldn’t bring himself to admit that “clinically appropriate”, in this unique and delicate situation, was not the best choice of words.
But no, everything is watertight.
Again, the Opposition picked holes in the arrangement. They zoned in on the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health insisting that the State tried up until the last minute to get the SVHG to sell them the land instead of leasing it, but the company was unwilling to do this. And yet, as everyone heard at Monday’s meeting of the health committee, the chairman of the group gave evidence that he had had no direct engagement on this question in the past five years.
“My understanding is the chair is ready to correct the record in respect of that,” was Micheál’s rather terse reply, leading to visions of James Menton being detained over the weekend in a basement room in Government Buildings, tied to a chair and subjected to Stephen Donnelly’s accounts of his time as a management consultant with McKinsey played at full volume on a loop until he cracked.
Anyway, the hospital is going ahead, because the Taoiseach knows the deal is so watertight it is the veritable duck’s arse of government deals.
And the Government has promised to expedite the process, which is great news. Just get on with building the damn thing and with any luck the calls for a public inquiry into the building costs might be ready in less than two years.
Fingers crossed.

LAST UPDATE|20 May 2022
MICHEÁL MARTIN HAS said there is “no substitute” for negotiations between the European Union and the UK Government to resolve issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
An Taoiseach was speaking in Belfast following meetings with political and business leaders.
He said: “There is no substitute for a substantive series of negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom Government in respect of solving issues in relation to the protocol.
“We accept legitimate issues have been raised, but it is our view that they can be resolved.”
The DUP is currently blocking the re-establishment of Stormont’s power-sharing Executive in protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol and has also prevented the Assembly from sitting because it cannot elect a Speaker without DUP support.
Martin said he had an interesting meeting with the Brexit business working group where he heard of “the many beneficial impacts of the protocol on many sectors” of the Northern Irish economy.
“We believe there can be a resolution of issues around the protocol, but the only way to do that is through a negotiated settlement.”
Meanwhile, Sinn Féin’s northern leader Michelle O’Neill “very much welcomes” US SpeakerNancy Pelosi’s intervention in a row over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Pelosi said the US Congress will not support a free trade agreement with the UK if the Government persists with “deeply concerning” plans to “unilaterally discard” the protocol, urging “constructive, collaborative and good faith negotiations” in order to uphold peace.
“They’ve [US Congress] made it very clear that there will be no trade deal with Britain if they undermine the Good Friday Agreement,” the Sinn Fein vice-president said as she visited Scotland’s First Minister in Edinburgh today.
“Those statements are very, very important because we have to protect the Good Friday Agreement.
“The protocol provides us some mitigation against the worst impact of Brexit – the hardest possible Brexit that’s been delivered by Boris Johnson in London and the DUP partners in Belfast.”

Speaking to reporters after he met with Martin, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said he held a “useful meeting” with An Taoiseach this afternoon and that his party is not interested in a “sticking plaster approach” to the Protocol standoff.
“We are not interested in a sticking plaster approach, or tinkering around the edges, it has to be fundamental change which respects Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market and nothing short of that will suffice,” he said.
Both Sinn Féin and the UUP have said that Executive should be able to operate in parallel with talks between the UK and EU but Donaldson appeared cool on that suggestion today.

“My understanding is that the (UK) government will bring forward the legislation early in June. We will note what the legislation says and we will take decisions based on the progress that is made,” he said.
In a statement last night, Donaldson had said that: “Dublin must belatedly recognise that if nothing is fixed then there will be no progress.”
Speaking onBBC’s Good Morning Ulsterprogramme today, Martin said that “in the democratic world” people should attend parliament.
“I think most people would agree that, in the democratic world, when people vote for the representatives and vote to elect to parliament, the first thing that should happen is that that Parliament should convene. It’s unheard of in the democratic world that the parliament would not convene in the aftermath of an election,” he said.

Following a meeting with An Taoiseach today, UUP leader Doug Beattie said they had had “a frank discussion” over the Protocol and the proposed “landing zone”.
It is expected that the UK is planning unilateral action to introduce separate “green” and “red” lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The different lanes would draw a distinction between goods destined to stay within the UK and those heading to the Republic of Ireland and beyond.
Speaking today, Beattie said that there should be “no requirement” to check goods that come from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland.

He also suggested that while it could be a lengthy process to revive the Stormont Executive, the Assembly could restart in a limited way in a shorter period of time.
“I get a sense that this legislation, this unilateral action will probably be laid before Parliament in the first two weeks of June, and that may be enough for a (Stormont) speaker then to be nominated, and that allows us to do limited work… and what happens after that will depend on whether or not the DUP get the Executive up and running,” he said.

Advances
During his appearance on the BBC, Martin said there had been “significant advances” from the European Commission on a range of issues in relation to the Protocol but he accused the British government of repeatedly “moving the goalposts”.
“Both governments must work hand in glove together with the parties in Northern Ireland,” he said.
Since the UK government announced that it is planning to introduce legislation to unilaterally change parts of the Protocol agreed between the EU and UK, concerns have been raised by both Irish, European and US politicians.
Earlier today, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney met with Truss in Turin where he detailed “Ireland’s opposition to the U.K. breaching international law” with their plan to unilaterally alter the Protocol.
Coveney called for the UK to go back into talks with the EU and to avoid taking unilateral action and “damaging international relations”

Irish officials have said that they do not expect an instant reaction from the European Commission if unilateral action is taken and have instead pushed for talks between the EU and UK to continue.

In an update last month to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Mr Justice Brian Cregan said he plans to issue his revised draft report to all relevant parties on or about April 30th.
The judge said his commission of inquiry, under way since 2015, could give a final report by August 30th if there is no High Court challenge to the findings. However, he said, he “cannot predict” the impact on the report’s timing if any party seeks a judicial review in the High Court.
Last month, the Taoiseach granted an extension to the inquiry for its work on Siteserv until August.
The judge is known to have said in preliminary conclusions last year that the Siteserv sale by Irish Bank Resolution Corporation was not “commercially sound”.
Several witnesses are said to have questioned such findings in submissions to the judge, whose draft report ran to 1,280 pages across 28 chapters.
In his 11th interim report to Mr Martin in March, the judge said “detailed submissions” on the draft running to more than 1,600 pages from 12 different parties. “These submissions raise a number of complex matters,” he said. “The commission is currently in the process of carefully considering all of the submissions received.”
Parties will be given eight weeks to review the next draft report, which means they will have until June 30th to make any further submissions if the findings are released on April 30th.
“If any submissions are made in response to the draft report, the commission will have to consider what (if any) action is appropriate in response. The commission estimates that it may require two months to review such submissions,” the March report said.
“If any party applies to the High Court…, the commission will also have to consider how best to respond to such application.”
Siterserv was sold to the Denis O’Brien-owned Millington for €45 million in 2012, with the IBRC writing off €119 million of the €150 million it was owed by the company.
The Siteserv deal was the first of 38 linked to the now liquidated IBRC, involving the write-off of nearly €2 billion in debt, to be investigated by the commission. In a previous interim report, the judge questioned his own powers to investigate some foreign-based individuals.

Pat Leahy,"‘Lessons have to be learned’ from Holohan TCD controversy, Taoiseach says",Micheál Martin says he has full confidence in Department of Health secretary general Robert Watt,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/lessons-have-to-be-learned-from-holohan-tcd-controversy-taoiseach-says-1.4849320?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-04-10T14:48:14+00:00,"The Taoiseach has said “lessons have to be learned” from the controversy over the appointment of Dr Tony Holohan to a Trinity College Dublin academic position. However Micheál Martin said he did not see there being further consequences for anyone, and said he had full confidence in the secretary general of the Department of Health Robert Watt.
“Transparency from the outset would have been appropriate,” he said. “I think it’s regrettable given the fact that Tony has played a very strong role in bringing us through the pandemic. But there has to be a process too and I think there has to be full transparency in relation to all of these issues.”
The chief medical officer on Saturday announced he would not to proceed with his secondment to TCD and will retire from July instead.
The appointment to the TCD role has sparked controversy since it emerged that it was intended that Dr Holohan leave on an open-ended secondment, an arrangement which is usually time-bound in the civil service. Dr Holohan said he did not wish “ to see the controversy of the last few days continuing”. The question of who would fund the role also caused controversy, with Trinity saying last week the post would be funded by the Department of Health.
Speaking on Sunday the Taoiseach said: “There will be a comprehensive summary and report tomorrow from the secretary general in health to the Minister for Health but I think certainly lessons have to be learned.”
“Anything that involves the spending of public money or any substantive multi-annual programme of research is a policy issue that does require approval by government.”
Mr Martin said he was “puzzled” by reports that Dr Holohan’s salary was not to come from public funds. “It’s clear to me that this was to be funded by the exchequer from what I know now.”
Mr Martin said that details given to him on Thursday by the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly shows the Holohan appointment was to funded by the Department of Health, through the Heallth Research Board, a state body.
Mr Martin suggested that the appointment was a policy matter, not a personnel issue. But he also said that any discussion on the issue should not be “personalised”. He said he had full confidence in Mr Watt, describing him as a “capable public servant”.
“This is very regrettable issue the way it has unfolded and transpired,” he said. “Could have been done better. Lessons have to be learned from it.” “We’re not happy with it,” he said.
Asked if there should be consequences for people involved, Mr Martin said he would prefer to focus on the lessons to be learned. Asked if this meant there would be no consequences, Mr Martin said: “Let’s see the report tomorrow and let’s take it in terms of the lessons to be learned.”
Elsewhere Sinn Fein’s health spokesman David Cullinane and Fianna Fail TD John Laharte, both members of the Oireachtas health committee, respectively described the handling of Dr Holohan’s planned move to Trinity as “a mess” and “ham-fisted”.
Both TDs said they wanted it discussed before the committee in the coming days and to have the Minster for Health and Mr Watt, attend.
The “mess” is entirely the making of “very senior civil servants within the Department but also of the Minister for Health who failed to clarify many of these issues for days” and has “real questions to answer”, Mr Cullinane told RTE Radio One’s This Week.
“I believe senior civil servants are running rings around the Minister for Health not just on this issue but also the establishment of regional health areas, consultant contract talks, all of thse issue which are really important”.
Senior officials in the HSE and the Department, not the Minister, are “running the show”, and that’s not the way it should be, he said.
The Holohan matter is a mess, he added, of the head of the Department, who, when before the committee last week was asked about issues of process and procedures and “questions were not answered”.
At the end of the day there has to be fair procedures when it comes to public appointments and issues in relation to public pay and very senior officials, he said. “There has to be robust procedures but they also have to be implemented and followed without fear or favour.”
The communication around this was “quite poor but we were also told this was a secondment when the civil service handbook makes quite clear that secondments can only be temporary arrangements and for a specified period of time and yet we were told this was a permanent transfer.”
The Deputy said he never had a difficulty with Dr Holohan taking up the TCD position, thought that had value and it would have been “acceptable”, “if we were told from day one, he was not on a secondment but was taking up a permanent role in Trinity College”.
All of that confusion “was entirely the Department’s own making” and the Minister’s authority “is being called into question now because he failed to pause the process, he failed to ask the hard questions and it fell to the Taoiseach to intervene and I think that’s really problematic for the Minister.”
“We’re still none the wiser as to who came up with this procedure, who processed, who signed off on it.”
Mr Cullinane said he wished Dr Holohan well in his retirement but would have preferred to see him working in the public system. This outcome, as well as being a blow for the former CMO personally, is “a blow for the public service and for many of us who want to see a beefing up of public health departments as well as public health specialists working in the public system”.
He agreed with Mr Laharte there should be an early meeting of the health committee to discuss the report due on Monday from the Secretary General on the matter.
Mr Laharte said he would welcome an early meeting to discuss the report and to call whatever witnesses, including the Minister and Mr Watt to attend.
He said Dr Holohan’e experience was clearly invaluable in the creation of the TCD position and the intention was to ensure courses would be designed to ensure that any gaps concerning pandemic related courses would be filled.
The perception of the process “is the key thing”, he said. This is the first government that created a cabinet position of Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and Research and he would have thought, if Trinity wanted to create this, one of its first ports of call would be government for an input because of the public and mental health and other aspects. A “much more holistic approach” was needed to the matter, he said.
“One of the clear messages from this is that the public need to know that the government is in charge,” the TD said.
This has been “ham-fisted”, not just in terms of communications but terms of the design and creation of the position, and is “one of a series of less than transparent appointments to very senior positions in the civil service.”
He accepted it is “a continuous judgment call” in terms of what the secretary general and senior officials tell the Minister who cannot be overwhelmed or expected to know every detail in a department.
“This is a really significant appointment of a very, very senior public official held in high esteem by the public and a position understood and welcomed, while it allowed him to go to Trinity, it also maintained him as a public servant.”
It was very clear from the statements of government ministers when the appointment was announced they saw this as the departure of a public official, Mr Holohan, to Trinity, Mr Laharte said. “A Minister is only as good as the information he is given.”

In the statement, Mr Martin said the island of Ireland had been united in revulsion at Russian aggression against Ukraine and ""in our support and solidarity for the people of Ukraine"".
He stressed that it was incumbent on us all to protect and nurture the Belfast Agreement, which “marked a seismic milestone in the lifetime of this island”.
“It signalled a new beginning underpinned by peace and mutual respect – grounded in the principles of consent, democratic institutions, reconciliation and co-operation,” he said.
""The agreement was the product of many people's work. Of political and civic leaders across all traditions and communities in Northern Ireland together with the two governments [the British and Irish governments], and supported by the US and the EU.
“Through the agreement, we established new, interdependent political institutions – for Northern Ireland, North/South and east/west – and affirmed principles, rights and equal protections for all, and addressed issues of citizenship, identity and constitutional futures.
“It is important that we recognise the progress which has occurred since then.”
The Belfast Agreement was signed on Good Friday, April 10th, 1998, to secure peace in Northern Ireland. It consists of two closely related agreements: the British-Irish Agreement and the Multi-Party Agreement.
It led to the establishment of a system of devolved government in Northern Ireland and the creation of many new institutions, such as the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.
In his statement, Mr Martin said that since the agreement there was a whole generation that had grown up without the everyday threat of violence, in a society where tolerance, equality and mutual respect were now prioritised over division and conflict.
“ I would like to particularly acknowledge all those who work every day to build trust, develop relationships, and improve the lives of people on all parts of the island in support of the values underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.
“I know also that scars and trauma endure for many who suffered during the Troubles and there is unfinished business in resolving some of the issues and difficulties which remain.”
He added that the Irish Government was fully and deeply committed to working with the British government and all parties and communities in Northern Ireland to promote peace and reconciliation and support the full and effective operation of all the institutions of the Belfast Agreement.
“Through our Shared Island initiative, we are committed to redoubling our efforts to build meaningful connections, co-operation and trust between different communities and political traditions [in Ireland].
“We have set out a broad, positive, inclusive agenda, founded on working through the Good Friday Agreement, towards a shared future for all.
“I firmly believe, that through sustained commitment and shared endeavour, we will realise the transformational potential of the agreement for how we live together on this island,” Mr Martin said.

The Irish prime minister has claimed that the UK'sRwandapolicy to deport migrants to central Africa has seen more people arrive in Ireland.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the UK's new immigration policy has seen a surge in asylum seekers arrive in Ireland.
The news comes after Tory leadership candidateLiz Trusshas said she will extend the controversial Rwanda asylum scheme, in a move to firm up support amongToryparty voters in the race to succeedBoris Johnson.
Mr Martin said that refugees are using the Common Travel Area to apply for asylum after over 40,000 Ukrainians arrived in the country and as it was reported that most refugees are applying for leave to remain in Ireland through offices in Dublin and not at airports.
Mrs Truss today vowed to implement a hard line on immigration if she wins the keys to No 10 – including extending the scheme under which migrants who cross the Channel in small boats can be sent to Rwanda.
Liz Truss, pictured on Saturday in Marden, in an interview with the Mail on Sunday, suggested that as Prime Minister she would extend the Rwanda policy, despite it currently being in legal limbo
The Irish government has claimed that the UK's Rwanda policy to deport migrants to central Africa has seen more people arrive in Ireland. Pictured: A group of migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, onboard a Border Force vessel following a small boat incident in the Channel on Monday
2022 figures so far show numbers increasing at pace and look likely to eclipse 2021's figures
The Foreign Secretary uses an interview with The Mail on Sunday to try to cement her early lead over Rishi Sunak by promising to increase frontline border staff by 20 per cent, and by striking Rwanda-style deals with more countries.
Her pledges come as Mr Sunak – who has denied claims he tried to block the controversial policy while in Cabinet –yesterday set out his own ten-point plan to tackle immigration, which he promised would be one of ‘five major emergency responses’ he would enact during his first 100 days as Prime Minister.
Ms Truss says: ‘The Rwanda policy is the right policy. I’m determined to see it through to full implementation, as well as exploring other countries that we can work on similar partnerships with. It’s the right thing to do.
‘I’m also determined to make sure we have the right level of forces at our border. I’m going to increase the Border Force to make sure that we have the proper protection in place directly at the border.’
Ms Truss tells the MoS: ‘I’m determined to end the appalling people trafficking we’re seeing. I make sure things get done, and I will be working with my colleagues to deliver this as an absolute priority.
‘I understand it’s a priority for people and we need to make sure our immigration system is fair, and this illegal immigration that we’re seeing across the Channel is both unfair and incredibly dangerous, and it is one of my priorities to make sure it is sorted.’ She adds: ‘We need to make sure that the British Bill of Rights fully delivers on giving the UK Government the powers and UK Parliament the sovereignty to be able to deliver the policy in full. That’s very important for me.
‘Britain’s borders will be protected under my leadership and I will do what it takes to make the Rwanda deal fully implemented and also look to other arrangements with other countries.’
Mr Sunak’s plan includes new laws to tighten the definition of who qualifies for asylum, the introduction of an annual cap set by Parliament on the number of refugees the UK accepts and withholding aid from countries that fail to co-operate over the return of migrants.
The former Chancellor has also promised to hold ‘the French to account with clear targets for stopping boats’ while ending the ‘farce’ of using hotels to house migrants. Mr Sunak said: ‘Our immigration system is broken and we have to be honest about that.
In today’s interview, Ms Truss also takes aim at former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, who is supporting Mr Sunak, distances herself from comparisons with Baroness Thatcher and reveals her love of Bruce Springsteen and Honest Burgers.
Liz Truss (pictured in Marden on Saturday) has said she will extend the controversial Rwanda asylum scheme, in a move to firm up support among Tory party voters in the race to succeed Boris Johnson
Her intervention over immigration came after the initial stages of the Tory leadership campaign were dominated by rows over tax policy, with Ms Truss promising to axe Mr Sunak’s National Insurance rise to stimulate growth. The Foreign Secretary says that if she beats her rival in the ballot of party members on September 5 she will increase frontline Border Force staff from 9,000 to 10,800.
Ms Truss will also introduce a strengthened Bill of Rights to give a ‘sound legal basis’ to address illegal immigration.
‘Whether you believe that migration should be high or low, we can all agree that it should be legal and controlled.
‘Right now the system is chaotic, with law-abiding citizens seeing boats full of illegal immigrants coming from the safe country of France, with our sailors and coastguards seemingly powerless to stop them. It must stop and if I am Prime Minister I will stop it.’
The Rwandan Government has conceded that it currently only has the capacity to take 200 migrants from the UK, although spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said officials would be able to ‘scale up quickly’ and were ready to ‘take as many as the UK is willing to send’.
Britain has paid £120 million up front to Rwanda as part of the deal and could be liable for the cash even if the policy is ruled unlawful in a judicial review before the High Court in September.
Officials also confirmed migrants were free to leave Rwanda once they had arrived and could attempt new journeys back to the UK.
More than 10,000 migrants have arrived in the UK in small boats since the deal was signed in mid-April. In total, more than 15,000 have crossed the Channel this year, almost double the number that had arrived by this time last year.
Last week it emerged in a report by David Neal, the chief borders inspector, that Channel migrants who triggered alerts on security databases have been allowed to vanish after arriving in the UK.
Others were found to have arrived with guns or other weapons.
The Home Office sat on Mr Neal’s findings for five months until publishing them last week.
The report came a month after the first scheduled flight to Rwanda was blocked from departing after an 11th-hour ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.
Ms Truss adds: ‘In all of the areas that I’ve had direct responsibility for, whether it’s putting the toughest sanctions regime on Russia, whether it’s dealing with the issues in Northern Ireland and putting the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill to Parliament, whether it’s the trade deals I’ve negotiated, I’m somebody who gets things done and I’m prepared to take on the Whitehall orthodoxy, I’m prepared to take on the naysayers and the doubters around the country, and that is what I will absolutely do in this case because it is a priority to stop the appalling abuse that’s taking place in the Channel.’
Meanwhile, it has also been suggested,The Telegraphsaid, that Ireland has seen an accommodation crisis off the back of the measure forcing Ukrainians to be put in tents.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin (pictured) has made comments this week saying new migration measures in the UK has seen a spike in asylum seekers
The news comes as Mr Martin was defending Ireland's policy to suspend visa-free travel for refugees - but not Ukrainians - from 20 'safe' European countries for 12 months.
Speaking in Japan on Tuesday, he said: 'We have had the Department of Justice examining [the issue of asylum seekers] in terms of the convention around refugees in safe countries being in a position to travel. There has been a significant surge in people seeking international protection over the last number of months.
'I mean potentially we will have four to five times the number of people seeking international protection this year compared to pre-pandemic times.'
He added that he thinks that Rwanda policy has seen more people coming to utlise the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland, which means those travelling encounter visa-free travel.
A group of migrants are brought in to Dover, Kent, onboard a Border Force vessel following a small boat incident in the Channel on Monday
Mr Martin added: 'One can see, and maybe sense that that policy announcement, which I thought was a wrong policy announcement by the UK, a shocking sort of initiative in my view, to be doing some agreement with Rwanda, clearly may have motivated people utilising the Common Travel Area to come into the Republic – yes, I think it is one of a number of factors.'
An Irish government spokesman later clarified this comments to the Telegraph saying: 'Recent policy changes in other jurisdictions, including the UK, as the Taoiseach referred to, may be creating the perception of a less welcoming immigration and international protection environment, leading to secondary movements of applicants.'
The Irish government also believes this is happening as people travel between Northern Ireland and the Republic as 60 per cent of as asylum claims are being made at offices in Dublin and not the airport which typically sees almost two-thirds of asylum claims.
Earlier this week,the Irish Timesreported an average of 1,400 people are now arriving from Ukraine every week, with more than 40,000 fleeing to Ireland with a population of 5million.
It also said that the Irish Army is purchasing more tents to house Ukrainians which is already exasperating the country's existing housing crisis while the government offers €135 (£114.85) a night for hotels and B&Bs to house single adults.
It has also been suggested that Ireland has seen an accommodation crisis of the back of the measure forcing Ukrainians to be put in tents. Pictured: Environment Minister Eamon Ryan pictured on Thursday
Mr Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, has previously said on the Rwanda policy: 'There is a real challenge. It is very, very difficult. But we will have to manage. We committed at the very start of this war that the right thing to do – and the Irish people agree with this – is to keep our door open, unlike our neighbours who haven't taken the same approach.
'And unlike our neighbours, we don't agree with the sort of approach where you might send a refugee back to another country as a solution to what is a real challenging problem.'
He also clarified his view again on Sunday, saying: 'You don’t turn people away', according to theIrish Examiner.
The UK Home Office has refused to comment on the statements made by Mr Martin and Mr Ryan.

The Foreign Secretary uses an interview with The Mail on Sunday to try to cement her early lead over Rishi Sunak by promising to increase frontline border staff by 20 per cent, and by striking Rwanda-style deals with more countries.
Her pledges come as Mr Sunak – who has denied claims he tried to block the controversial policy while in Cabinet –yesterday set out his own ten-point plan to tackle immigration, which he promised would be one of ‘five major emergency responses’ he would enact during his first 100 days as Prime Minister.
Ms Truss says: ‘The Rwanda policy is the right policy. I’m determined to see it through to full implementation, as well as exploring other countries that we can work on similar partnerships with. It’s the right thing to do.
‘I’m also determined to make sure we have the right level of forces at our border. I’m going to increase the Border Force to make sure that we have the proper protection in place directly at the border.’
Ms Truss tells the MoS: ‘I’m determined to end the appalling people trafficking we’re seeing. I make sure things get done, and I will be working with my colleagues to deliver this as an absolute priority.
‘I understand it’s a priority for people and we need to make sure our immigration system is fair, and this illegal immigration that we’re seeing across the Channel is both unfair and incredibly dangerous, and it is one of my priorities to make sure it is sorted.’ She adds: ‘We need to make sure that the British Bill of Rights fully delivers on giving the UK Government the powers and UK Parliament the sovereignty to be able to deliver the policy in full. That’s very important for me.
‘Britain’s borders will be protected under my leadership and I will do what it takes to make the Rwanda deal fully implemented and also look to other arrangements with other countries.’
Mr Sunak’s plan includes new laws to tighten the definition of who qualifies for asylum, the introduction of an annual cap set by Parliament on the number of refugees the UK accepts and withholding aid from countries that fail to co-operate over the return of migrants.
The former Chancellor has also promised to hold ‘the French to account with clear targets for stopping boats’ while ending the ‘farce’ of using hotels to house migrants. Mr Sunak said: ‘Our immigration system is broken and we have to be honest about that.
In today’s interview, Ms Truss also takes aim at former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, who is supporting Mr Sunak, distances herself from comparisons with Baroness Thatcher and reveals her love of Bruce Springsteen and Honest Burgers.
Liz Truss (pictured in Marden on Saturday) has said she will extend the controversial Rwanda asylum scheme, in a move to firm up support among Tory party voters in the race to succeed Boris Johnson
Her intervention over immigration came after the initial stages of the Tory leadership campaign were dominated by rows over tax policy, with Ms Truss promising to axe Mr Sunak’s National Insurance rise to stimulate growth. The Foreign Secretary says that if she beats her rival in the ballot of party members on September 5 she will increase frontline Border Force staff from 9,000 to 10,800.
Ms Truss will also introduce a strengthened Bill of Rights to give a ‘sound legal basis’ to address illegal immigration.
‘Whether you believe that migration should be high or low, we can all agree that it should be legal and controlled.
‘Right now the system is chaotic, with law-abiding citizens seeing boats full of illegal immigrants coming from the safe country of France, with our sailors and coastguards seemingly powerless to stop them. It must stop and if I am Prime Minister I will stop it.’
The Rwandan Government has conceded that it currently only has the capacity to take 200 migrants from the UK, although spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said officials would be able to ‘scale up quickly’ and were ready to ‘take as many as the UK is willing to send’.
Britain has paid £120 million up front to Rwanda as part of the deal and could be liable for the cash even if the policy is ruled unlawful in a judicial review before the High Court in September.
Officials also confirmed migrants were free to leave Rwanda once they had arrived and could attempt new journeys back to the UK.
More than 10,000 migrants have arrived in the UK in small boats since the deal was signed in mid-April. In total, more than 15,000 have crossed the Channel this year, almost double the number that had arrived by this time last year.
Last week it emerged in a report by David Neal, the chief borders inspector, that Channel migrants who triggered alerts on security databases have been allowed to vanish after arriving in the UK.
Others were found to have arrived with guns or other weapons.
The Home Office sat on Mr Neal’s findings for five months until publishing them last week.
The report came a month after the first scheduled flight to Rwanda was blocked from departing after an 11th-hour ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.
Ms Truss adds: ‘In all of the areas that I’ve had direct responsibility for, whether it’s putting the toughest sanctions regime on Russia, whether it’s dealing with the issues in Northern Ireland and putting the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill to Parliament, whether it’s the trade deals I’ve negotiated, I’m somebody who gets things done and I’m prepared to take on the Whitehall orthodoxy, I’m prepared to take on the naysayers and the doubters around the country, and that is what I will absolutely do in this case because it is a priority to stop the appalling abuse that’s taking place in the Channel.’
Meanwhile, it has also been suggested,The Telegraphsaid, that Ireland has seen an accommodation crisis off the back of the measure forcing Ukrainians to be put in tents.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin (pictured) has made comments this week saying new migration measures in the UK has seen a spike in asylum seekers
The news comes as Mr Martin was defending Ireland's policy to suspend visa-free travel for refugees - but not Ukrainians - from 20 'safe' European countries for 12 months.
Speaking in Japan on Tuesday, he said: 'We have had the Department of Justice examining [the issue of asylum seekers] in terms of the convention around refugees in safe countries being in a position to travel. There has been a significant surge in people seeking international protection over the last number of months.
'I mean potentially we will have four to five times the number of people seeking international protection this year compared to pre-pandemic times.'
He added that he thinks that Rwanda policy has seen more people coming to utlise the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland, which means those travelling encounter visa-free travel.

Mr Martin added: 'One can see, and maybe sense that that policy announcement, which I thought was a wrong policy announcement by the UK, a shocking sort of initiative in my view, to be doing some agreement with Rwanda, clearly may have motivated people utilising the Common Travel Area to come into the Republic – yes, I think it is one of a number of factors.'
An Irish government spokesman later clarified this comments to the Telegraph saying: 'Recent policy changes in other jurisdictions, including the UK, as the Taoiseach referred to, may be creating the perception of a less welcoming immigration and international protection environment, leading to secondary movements of applicants.'
The Irish government also believes this is happening as people travel between Northern Ireland and the Republic as 60 per cent of as asylum claims are being made at offices in Dublin and not the airport which typically sees almost two-thirds of asylum claims.
Earlier this week,the Irish Timesreported an average of 1,400 people are now arriving from Ukraine every week, with more than 40,000 fleeing to Ireland with a population of 5million.
It also said that the Irish Army is purchasing more tents to house Ukrainians which is already exasperating the country's existing housing crisis while the government offers €135 (£114.85) a night for hotels and B&Bs to house single adults.
It has also been suggested that Ireland has seen an accommodation crisis of the back of the measure forcing Ukrainians to be put in tents. Pictured: Environment Minister Eamon Ryan pictured on Thursday
Mr Ryan, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, has previously said on the Rwanda policy: 'There is a real challenge. It is very, very difficult. But we will have to manage. We committed at the very start of this war that the right thing to do – and the Irish people agree with this – is to keep our door open, unlike our neighbours who haven't taken the same approach.
'And unlike our neighbours, we don't agree with the sort of approach where you might send a refugee back to another country as a solution to what is a real challenging problem.'
He also clarified his view again on Sunday, saying: 'You don’t turn people away', according to theIrish Examiner.
The UK Home Office has refused to comment on the statements made by Mr Martin and Mr Ryan.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he has “no time” for a “toxic discussion” surrounding trans people, adding that “acceptance is key”.
Martin made the comments toLGBT+ group NXFahead of Dublin Pride weekend and specifically mentioned debates in the UK which he described as “particularly negative”.
Ireland passed theGender Recognition Act in 2015which has provided people the legal right to gender recognition based on self-declaration for the past seven years.
The UK had planned to introduce similar laws to legislate for gender recognition based on self-declaration but this was recently shelved by Boris Johnson’s governmentamid an increasingly hostile debate.
Speaking today, An Taoiseach said he was aware of the “toxic” debate in the UK and added that it should be avoided here.
“I’d be very concerned about that and and I’ve watched it in the UK and we certainly don’t need that kind of debate in Ireland. We don’t need to have that kind of debate in Ireland,” he said.

“It’s very superficial I sense at times and it’s sort of plucking one aspect of it or one manifestation of it and turning it into a big sort of toxic discussion, which I have no time for and we don’t need that.”

Martin went on to argue that the manner in which a debate is conducted is important because trans people “face a very difficult journey from the earliest age”, adding that “we should fully accept and acknowledge their identity in the first instance”.
The context of the question from Adam Long of NXF camefollowing the controversy over three days of debate about trans issueson the Liveline programme which led to the decision by Dublin Pride to end it’s partnership with RTÉ.
Martin said he had not heard the debates which caused controversy but that “some types of programmes or some types of forum are not conducive to an informed debate”.
He added “freedom of speech is very important in society” but that this must be balanced with “ensuring that anything that gets said isn’t undermining a person and that person’s identity”.
Martin said that he will be in attendance at the Dublin Pride march this weekend which he expects to be “a joyous occasion”.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN is to travel to visit Kyiv tomorrow.
Martin’s visit to Kyiv follows an invite from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent telephone call.
The leaders are expected to discuss Zelenskyy’s government’s hopes to become a full member of the European Union.
It is understood that Martin and his team travelled to the region earlier today and will cross into Ukraine tomorrow morning. It will be the first official visit of an Irish Taoiseach to the country.
Sources have said that a security team from An Garda Síochána has been dispatched to the area and will accompany the Taoiseach.
It will be the second high level visit of the Irish Government with a previous visit by Minister forForeign Affairs and Defence Simon Coveneyvisiting the Kyiv and Bucha in April.
At the start of June Martin told the European Parliament that Ireland “strongly supports” Ukraine’s application to join the bloc.
Addressingthe parliament in Strasbourghe said membership of the union has been “transformative” for Ireland, describing it as “an historic enabler of sustained progress”.

Martin said he is “humbled and inspired” by the courage of the people of Ukraine and said he hopes that the European Council sends them a “clear and positive” message when it meets this month.
He said the prospect of membership can be a powerful driver of reform and membership itself is the most powerful tool to ensure peace and security in Europe.
A statement has been requested from a spokesperson for the Taoiseach.
Coveney this evening confirmed that Martin would travel to Ukraine, following questions in the Dáil from Independent TD Mattie McGrath about his whereabouts.
“The Taoiseach is everywhere bar in the chamber, when he so sought after the job of Taoiseach [...] instead of being here answering to the parliament,” McGrath said.
“This is the second or third week in a row that he hasn’t been here for Leaders’ Questions, and we have limited time and he’s all over the place.”
“He’s in Ukraine, deputy,” Coveney replied.
However, McGrath continued to question why the Taoiseach wasn’t in the Dáil.
“Where is he? This is Ireland. He’s responsible to this parliament, not the Ukrainian parliament. That shouldn’t justify him not being here.”
Ireland has taken in more than 36,000 Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine at the end of February, and has given millions of euro in humanitarian support and assistance to the country, as well as health equipment and medical donations worth over 4.5 million euro.
Zelenskyy has thanked Ireland for its “active support of Ukraine’s European aspirations”.

LAST UPDATE|6 Jul 2022
THE TAOISEACH HAS held a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv as part of a visit to discuss how Ireland and the EU can support Ukraine.
Micheál Martin travelled to the Ukrainian capital this morning to meet authorities and witness sites that have been devastated by the Russian army after Zelenskyy extended an invitation during a recent phone call.
He planned to communicate Irish people’s solidarity with Ukraine and express Ireland’s support for continuing sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime and Ukraine’s path to becoming an EU member.
He has visited Irpin and Borodyanka, two urban areas in the Kyiv province that Russia heavily hit in the early weeks of its invasion, including attacks on civilian buildings.
He tweeted that it is “difficult to comprehend the devastation and inhumanity” of Russia’s attacks in the region.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Zelenskyy today, the Taoiseach said he visited Kyiv to express Ireland’s solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine.
“We admire you and we are with you. Russia’s brutal war against this beautiful democratic country is a gross violation of international law. It is an affront to everything that Ireland stands for. It cannot and it will not be allowed to stand,” Martin said.
The Fianna Fáil leader noted that Ireland has provided additional funding to the International Criminal Court to enable it to investigate war crimes. He also congratulated Zelenskyy’s government for achieving European Union candidate status.
“I’ve always made clear from the outset our strong view that Ukraine belongs to the European Union. The values that people are fighting and dying for today are European values. Our values.
“But it was the commitment and the hard work of the government in Kyiv that convinced the European Commission to come forward with a positive recommendation so quickly, and it’s a richly deserved outcome.
“Because we in Ireland have been transformed by our 50 years membership of the European Union and we want the very same transformation for you,” Martin said.

He has also travelled to Bucha, another epicentre of destruction, where he viewed a mass grave found near a church.
A local cleric showed him the site and a photo exhibition of the bodies and of people found shot dead on the streets.

The Taoiseach also visited the Holodomor Memorial in Kyiv, and laid a wreath at foot of the Bitter Memory of Childhood statue, which commemorates the victims of the famine in 1932-33.
The famine, which occurred in Soviet Ukraine, is estimated to have killed up to 10 million people.
“Both Ukraine and Ireland know the suffering and pain of famine,” he said in a tweet.
“Russia must not be allowed to use food as a weapon in this immoral and unjustified war.”
The Taoiseach and Zelenskyy then held a bilateral meeting, after which the Ukrainian president posted a social media message expressing his gratitude.
“Thank you that in this defining time for our state Ireland is near,” he said.
“I am grateful that Ireland stands by our side in this crucial time for our country.”
As well as his bilateral meeting with President Zelensky, the Taoiseach also held talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.
“The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s immoral and unprovoked war of terror,” Martin said.
Speaking ahead of the visit, the Taoiseach said that the “people of Ireland stand with Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s immoral and unprovoked war of terror”.
“The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes, and I will use my visit to express Ireland’s support for moves to hold those behind these attacks fully accountable,” he said.

In June, the EUofficially grantedUkraine candidate status to become a member state, opening the way for it to begin the complex process of fulfilling the union’s criteria to join the bloc.
The EU Council, which is comprised of the heads of state and government of the 27 member countries – including Taoiseach Micheál Martin – met in Brussels to discuss the enlargement of the union after applications from Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.
Ukraine and Moldova were approved for formal candidacy, with Georgia was offered a ‘European perspective’ while working onprioritiesset out by the European Commission.
The Taoiseach described the Council meeting as “significant” and “historic”.
“We in Ireland know what the European Union means, being a member of the European Union. It’s the 50th anniversary of Ireland’s decision to join the European Union, probably the single most transformative decision and event that happened in modern Irish history,” he said.
“I always cannot comprehend how we could ever refuse accession to other member states, because we know that membership itself can be transformative and can spur on reforms, can spur on economic development.”

Yesterday, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s defence ministry said that Russian forces outside Donbas were “trying to bind our troops in order to prevent them from moving to the battle areas”.
Zelenskyy, speaking in his evening address, said he was pressing for upgraded anti-missile systems as air siren alerts sounded around much of the country, including in Kyiv.
He said that “the Russian army does not take any breaks” and Ukraine’s task “is to hold on”.

Mr Martin is in the Ukrainian capital where he held talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The leaders met in Mr Zelensky’s heavily fortified offices in the city to discuss the war and Irish and EU efforts to support Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.
In a speech in Kyiv on Wednesday, Mr Martin said he wished to express Ireland’s solidarity with the people of Ukraine.
“We admire you and we are with you.  Russia’s brutal war against this beautiful, democratic country is a gross violation of international law.  It is an affront to everything that Ireland stands for.  It cannot and it will not be allowed to stand,” Mr Martin said.
The Taoiseach paid tribute to President Zelenskiy on achieving EU candidate status, saying “Ukraine belongs to the European Union” and that Ireland would “be with you every step of the way and we’ll do what we can to help”.
Prior to the talks with the Ukrainian president, Mr Martin visited a museum in Kyiv that is exhibiting items from the war, including damaged Russian military vehicles and missile fragments.
He placed a teddy bear at a nearby memorial to the children killed in the conflict so far.
Mr Martin then visited a memorial commemorating the lives lost in the Holodomor famine in Ukraine in the early 1930s.
The Taoiseach placed a wreath at the site and later lit a candle in an underground part of the memorial.
He began a trip to Kyiv by viewing the conflict-scarred suburbs of Borodyanka, Bucha and Irpin.
The tour included a sombre visit to the site of a mass grave in the grounds of a church in Bucha.
Mr Martin is using the visit to Kyiv to reiterate Ireland’s solidarity with the Ukrainian authorities in the face of the Russian invasion.
His day-long itinerary in the war-torn city began with a trip to Borodyanka – a town on the outskirts of Kyiv that has suffered widespread damage under Russian shelling.
On the 30-minute drive from the railway station, the Taoiseach passed Hostomel airport, where his convoy stopped to observe a demolished bridge.
The delegation also drove past bombed-out warehouses, shopping centres and petrol stations.
The scale of Ukrainian efforts to defend their capital was evident, with numerous bunkers and fortifications visible on the journey.
In Borodyanka, Mr Martin met the town’s mayor and viewed apartment blocks gutted by fire during the Russian bombardment.
From there, Mr Martin visited the site of a mass grave in Bucha. The grave was discovered in the grounds of the church of St Andrew.
A local cleric showed Mr Martin the site and an associated exhibition of graphic photographs of exhumed bodies and pictures of civilians left dead on the streets of the suburb when Russian forces retreated.
The Irish delegation then travelled to nearby Irpin where the Taoiseach was shown badly-damaged apartment blocks that had been hit by Russian shells.
Afterwards, Mr Martin said: “It is difficult to comprehend the devastation and inhumanity of Russia’s attacks on Irpin, Borodyanka and Bucha.
He said it was “clear how important it is for women and children to get to Ireland to escape trauma and brutality. We stand with Ukraine.”

Mr Martin said Ireland will stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s “immoral and unprovoked war of terror”, in advance of his arrival in Kyiv on Wednesday morning.
He will engage with Ukrainian authorities on how Ireland and the EU can support the country’s current and future needs.
Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr Martin said: “The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes, and I will use my visit to express Ireland’s support for moves to hold those behind these attacks fully accountable.
“The spirit and resolve of the Ukrainian people has inspired us all, and Ireland will provide every support for Ukraine’s path to full EU Membership, and continue to welcome and support civilians fleeing this war.”

Mr Martin was invited to Ukraine last month by Mr Zelenskiy, who also singled him out for thanks after the European Council approved Ukraine’s bid for candidate status at a recent summit in Brussels. Mr Martin was a strong early supporter of Ukraine’s bid for membership of the EU.
He will become the latest in a series of western leaders to visit the Ukrainian capital since Russia’s invasion of the country in late February.
It also comes after Mr Putin on Monday declared victory in seizing the eastern Ukrainian province of Luhansk, with his troops escalating their offensive in neighbouring Donetsk.
Mr Martin has warned previously that the Russian president appeared to be leveraging its natural gas supplies to exert maximum pressure on Europe ahead of the winter period.
Ireland has also taken in more than 36,000 Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of the Russian invasion.
The Irish State has given €20 million in humanitarian support and assistance to the country, as well as health equipment and medical donations worth more than €4.5 million.

LAST UPDATE|9 Aug 2022
Tipperary hurling star Dillon Quirke died last Friday “doing what he loved”, in the Premier County’s home of hurling, his funeral mass heard today.
Mr Quirke, 24, who catapulted through the hurling ranks from underage to the Tipperary senior hurling team, died after he collapsed while captaining Clonoulty Rossmore against Kilruane MacDonaghs, during a county senior hurling championship match at Semple Stadium, Thurles, last Friday.
The idyllic rural village of Clonoulty came to a standstill as the local hurling legend’s remains were first driven by hearse from his home to his local GAA pitch, before his coffin was shouldered almost 2km to St. John the Baptist Church, as it passed hundreds of silent standing mourners on the way.
Members of the Tipperary County Board, along with President of the GAA Larry McCarthy, led the cortège to the church where local hurling and camogie players as well as Mr Quirke’s Tipperary teammates, performed guards of honour.
In a loving tribute to his only son, Mr Quirke’s heartbroken father Dan Quirke said: “Dillon was a beautiful son, my best friend, our hero. He came into this world a fighter, born premature following a road accident, and he left it a champion and a true legend.”
Mr Quirke’s sister Shannon read a poem which championed her brother’s hurling skills and remembered him as a “fighter in the skies” defender, who was also “deadly in attack”.
In a tribute to his nephew, Clonoulty Rossmore chairman Andrew Fryday, told mourners: “Dillon was going so well in that match last Friday night, he was a leading player, a leading player, leading from the front, showing his ability and his skills”.
Becoming emotional,Fryday added: “Then a nightmare struck and we all know what happened. It was a disaster for us to see him leave Semple stadium in the way he left, but while he was in there, lads, he left it the way he wanted to leave it – he left it as the shining star that he was.”

Fryday thanked the wider “GAA family”, their neighbours and friends, and their hurling rivals Kilruane MacDonaghs, for their “dignity and support” since last Friday night.
“It hasn’t been easy since then, and I suppose if the truth be known, we are all one big happy family in the GAA, yes we go out (on the pitch) on days and cut each other asunder, but when it comes to it all and the chips are down, we are all behind each other lads and we stand up together and we have seen that here massively, so thank you.”
Fryday also paid special thanks to last Friday’s match referee Michael Kennedy; the “magnificent staff at Semple stadium”; their club’s team physio Ciara Gleeson, HSE paramedics, the Order of Malta, Gardai, and staff at Clonmel Hospital, who all tried valiantly to save Mr Quirke.
Fryday said Dillon was destined for hurling greatness, and noted a long list of his nephew’s hurling achievements.
“Last Friday evening, Dillon made a triumphant exit from his life, doing what he loved, with his teammates, and the great friends he loved so much, and in front of the people he cherished most – his family.”
“He was such a lovely, lovely fella, a perfect gentleman, I suppose he was what any mother or father would like to have had as a son, and if you go though his hurling career, he is probably what any manager or any trainer of a team would like to have as a leader and as an inspiration to others around him.”
“What an inspiring hero he was to us, both on and off the field. Dillon, until we meet again, go gently into the good night and shine brightly.”
Fr Tom Hearne, PP, Clonoulty Rossmore, said the parish had been “stunned” by Mr Quirke’s death, who he said had achieved “perfection in so short a time”.
The President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, was represented at the funeral by Commandant Deirdre Newell, and the Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, was represented by Commandant Claire Mortimer.
After the mass, Dillon Quirke, who is survived by his parents Dan and Hazel, sisters Shannon and Kellie, was laid to rest under a blanket of warm sunshine, in the adjoining Clonoulty cemetery.

TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has defended his and Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s attendance at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, telling the Dáil that he stayed “in a four star hotel” for the duration.
During Leaders’ Questions today, People Before Profit TD Mick Barry enquired about the cost of the trip and and joked that it was unlikely that Varadkar had “slept in a car”, a reference toreports of TDs sleeping in cars due to a lack of hotel roomsin Dublin
Both Martin and Varadkar attended the summit in the Swiss alpine resort this week, which has returned following a two-year Covid-enforced hiatus.
Martin spoke at a panel eventalongside fellow EU leaders and Varadkar also spoke at an event about the future of work. Both also conducted media interviews with international outlets.
Earlier this week, People Before Profit’s Paul Murphy TD said it was “questionable” whether it was required for both Taoiseach and Tánaiste to attend.
Today, Barry went further and enquired Varadkar’s accommodation arrangements during the summit:
The Cork North Central TD also asked the Tánaiste whether an increase in the minimum wage would be appropriate to help people deal with the rising cost of living.

Responding to the question about Davos, Varadkar responded that the attendance of both leaders at the summit was an important opportunity for the country and he added that he “flew commercial” to the event:
He added: “I flew commercial and stayed in a four star hotel and no doubt, they charged for it, but it was nonetheless a four star hotel and a commercial flight.”
Varadkar was back in the Dáil today.Oireachtas.ieOireachtas.ie
Varadkar was also asked during Leader’s Questions about the decision of Paypal to cut over 300 jobs from its operations in Dundalk and in his constituency in Dublin.
Varadkar said it was a matter “of great regret” that Paypal had made the decision but that he had spoken to the company and was told that it “remains committed” to the remainder of its 2,000 employees in Ireland.
“I have received an assurance from the company that the redundancy package that they offer will be a good one. I don’t know the details of that yet but I will be following up on that matter because I think it is important that if there are in our letting people go that they get a decent redundancy package to help them get on with their lives,” he said.
Varadkar added that he does not believe the job losses are representative of the wider employment picture in the country as a whole.
“We are approaching full employment in Ireland, which is a job for everyone who wants one. I think that’s a very positive thing,” he said.

Naomi O’Leary,Ireland backs Ukraine joining EU in face of ‘imperialist’ invasion - Taoiseach,Micheál Martin recalls Irish history of famine in condemning theft of Ukrainian grain,https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2022/06/08/ireland-backs-ukraine-joining-eu-in-face-of-imperialist-invasion-taoiseach/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-06-08T11:11:11+00:00,"Ireland strongly backs Ukraine’s aspirations to join the European Union at a time when it is defending its territory and self-determination from an “imperialist regime”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told the European Parliament.
In an address to mark 50 years since Ireland voted by referendum to join what was then the European Economic Community, Mr Martin said the EU had been “transformative” for Ireland and others.
“I strongly support Ukraine’s application for membership,” Mr Martin said, expressing hope that when EU national leaders meet later this month “it will be possible to send the people of Ukraine a clear and positive message” about their future in the union”.
He paid tribute to the “extraordinary courage and resolve of the people of Ukraine as they defend their country and their right to determine their own future”.
“The conflict is, at its most fundamental, about two utterly incompatible views of the world – autocratic and democratic. The new imperialism of Putin’s regime must not stand,” Mr Martin said. “In 2014 the people of Ukraine took to the streets to demand a democratic and European future. For this they suffered invasion and partition. We did too little to stand with the people of Ukraine then. We did too little to reject [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s new imperialism and his demand to control other countries in a sphere of influence.”
He recalled Ireland’s experience of famine, condemning “the illegal appropriation” of agricultural production in Ukraine which he said risked causing starvation in vulnerable countries in the Middle East and Africa. “It is hard to comprehend that hunger itself has been weaponised,” Martin said.
In welcoming remarks, the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, said Ireland “plays a central role in shaping common policies”, and had moved from being a net recipient of funds to a net contributor due to its economic “success story”.
“This parliament is attached to multilingualism and with the Irish language now a fully fledged official EU language let me say in Irish: go raibh maith agat,” Ms Metsola said.
In comments on his arrival at the parliament, Mr Martin said the people of Ukraine were “defending against an imperialist regime that is wreaking havoc and destruction” and that “given Ireland’s history, that’s something that’s anathema to us”.
Russia’s investment in “extremist parties and disinformation in our countries” showed that for Mr Putin, “the destruction of the EU was a core policy objective”.
When Ireland held its referendum in 1972 to join the EEC, revolutionary leaders who had fought for independence played a key role in advocating accession, Mr Martin said, noting at the time that Ireland was the poorest country in Europe. “They did not see Europe as a threat to our sovereignty, but as an enabler of our sovereignty. They rejected the idea of nationalism as a narrow and defensive concept. Time and time again this decision has been vindicated.”
The Taoiseach told the speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, who was also in Strasbourg to address the European Parliament, that his country had Ireland’s unequivocal support and was “honoured” to host 34,000 Ukrainian refugees who sought safety.“We strongly support the toughest possible sanctions – and we do so understanding that this involves costs for us all,” he said.
Mr Stefanchuk appealed to the EU to grant Ukraine the status of an official membership candidate in the key meeting on June 24th, telling the gathered MEPs “I’m really grateful to you, to your peoples. I’m very grateful to all who fight together with Ukraine.”

IrishCentral Staff,Will Christmas lights be a victim of Ireland's energy crisis?,Energy Minister Eamon Ryan met with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday to discuss ways of alleviating the energy crisis. ,https://www.irishcentral.com/news/christmas-lights-victim-energy-crisis,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-09-08T08:51:38+00:00,"Christmas lights may be a victim of Ireland's ongoing energy crisis, with local authorities across Ireland set to reassess every measure of energy usage ahead of the winter months.
Energy Minister Eamon Ryan met with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday to discuss ways of alleviating the energy crisis.
Ryan said he would not insist on local authorities restricting festivities and light displays this Christmas but added that each authority will have to reassess their energy usage and consider every measure that could help ease the crisis.
""I think local authorities are starting to look at that. They are starting to consider every measure but we’re not being prescriptive down to that level yet,"" Ryan said ahead of the meeting with Varadkar and Martin.
Speaking on RTÉ's Prime Time on Tuesday night, Ryan said he could not guarantee that there would be no blackouts over the winter.
He said a number of different factors will determine energy supply, including the performance of an old fossil fuel plant that wasn't available when needed in previous years.
""I think the blackouts will depend, more than anything else, on the availability of that fossil fuel plant, where we’ve had difficulties. But one of the ways to avoid that is being clever in reducing our use. And that will, not only, give us security benefits, it will also help cut the bills,"" Ryan told Prime Time.
Ryan added that the Government's Reduce Your Use campaign sets out a number of different ways that households can save power over the winter months.
However, he said the Government encouraged people to ""stay warm"", adding that people should be ""clever"" with their energy usage.
He said schools, libraries, and other essential public facilities will be protected over winter.
""Children benefit from being in school… we need our children in school,"" he told Prime Time.
He said keeping libraries warm and busy over the winter is ""exactly"" what the Irish Government should be doing, adding that many peoples use libraries as a social hub and a place to stay warm.
""When it comes to libraries, don’t shut facilities that actually provide a really important social function in the middle of difficult times.
""I think we’re going to have to look at every single building and every single institution to look at their energy bills and look at how they use energy because they’re going to be hit with higher gas and oil bills if that’s their heating system.""
Ryan said he hoped the Irish Government could introduce measures very quickly that help cushion the blow of mounting energy bills.
One proposal is to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies that have experienced a spike in profits due to soaring prices. However, the Government is reluctant to introduce a windfall tax because it would mainly impact wind energy companies that the Government is reliant on to invest billions in off-shore turbines.
Ryan announced on Wednesday that households will receive another energy credit before Christmas to help cover the mounting cost of energy bills. The Government had previously announced a €200 reduction in energy bills earlier in the year.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN held his first call with new British Prime Minister Liz Truss.
Truss became the new leader after beating Rishi Sunak for the leadership of the Conservative Party earlier this week.
Martin started the call by extending his condolences to the British people on the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
A statement released by the Taoiseach said the two reflected on the British queen’s historic State visit to Ireland in 2011 and its contribution to advancing reconciliation and relations on these islands.
The Taoiseach also offered his congratulations to the Prime Minister on her appointment, and told how he looked forward to working constructively with her.
A Government spokesperson said: “They discussed the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine, their support for Ukraine, and recognised the substantive EU-UK cooperation as part of the global response.
“They exchanged views on common challenges including soaring energy prices and the rising cost of living.
“They discussed a range of issues of mutual concern, including the Northern Ireland Protocol, and agreed to keep in close contact in the weeks ahead.”

LAST UPDATE|18 Sep 2022
WORLD LEADERS ARE travelling to the UK ahead of tomorrow’s funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London.
President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Micheál Martin both paid their respects to the queen at her lying in state in Westminster Hall today.
Martin said that the late queen “made an enormous contribution” to reconciliation and Anglo-Irish relations through “her authentic actions”.
Speaking to reporters, the Taoiseach said that “her warmth, her authentic actions, and by actions and by what she did, she made an enormous contribution”.
“I think it also reflects the breadth and the depth of the relationship between Britain and Ireland. Between the British people and the Irish people, and many Irish in Britain, for whom this is a sad occasion in terms of the passing of Queen Elizabeth.
“I do appreciate the invitation to be here, accompanying the president, on such a sad occasion, but also one which allows us to reflect, to recognise Queen Elizabeth’s contribution to the quality of life and particularly reconciliation between these two islands, and was happy to take that opportunity.”
Martin also met UK Prime Minister Liz Truss today.
Truss is also meeting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Polish president Andrzej Duda in Downing Street.
Truss had been due to meet US president Joe Biden, a milestone of her early premiership, but the talks were cancelled, with a “full bilateral meeting” scheduled instead for Wednesday, when they are set to be in New York for the UN General Assembly.

She will also have an audience with King Charles III before attending his reception for visiting heads of state at Buckingham Palace.

At Westminster Abbey, final preparations are being put in place ready for the funeral tomorrow.

LAST UPDATE|1 Oct 2022
THE FIANNA FÁIL Ard Fheis has rejected a motion calling for the Government to move towards abolishing the Universal Social Charge (USC).
Capping civil servants salaries, abolishing the USC and setting up a dedicated Garda transport police were just some of the motions voted on today at the party’s event in the RDS.
Speaking about the proposal to abolish the USC, Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath said it’s not currently Government policy to move towards abolition.
He said the USC brings in the region of €4 to €5 billion a year.
“In line with the programme for Government, which we have negotiated, which the party has endorsed, our focus is on income tax and continuing to increase credits, continuing to increase the entry point at a higher rate,” said McGrath.
Increasing tax credits is the Government’s intention into the future, he said.
“We will continue with that policy during the lifetime of this Government, continuing to reduce the burden on middle income workers in particular.
“There is a limit to what you can do through tax alone for people on quite low levels of income. And that’s why you need to address other issues like the cost-of-living, the cost of childcare, the cost of education, the cost of health, the cost of transport, and so on. But I think it is important we would protect the taxation base, and not narrow it unnecessarily into the future,” he said.

McGrath said there is a commitment to examine the idea of a third tax band, as proposed by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar.
“We have given a commitment in the context of the budget to examine what the impact would be of a third rate of income tax. So we will conduct that analysis over the coming months to see if it has merit, what are the pitfalls in terms of margin rate relief on pension contributions, and so on.
“But we’ll come to a view on that in the months ahead and make a final decision then in advance of the budget next year,” said the minister.
In addition, the party also accepted a motion to reject the Taxation Commission’s recommendation on inheritance tax.
Fianna Fáil party
The party Ard Fheis is being seen as an opportunity torefocus on the party’s ambitions, particular ahead of the Taoiseach’s rotation in December, when Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar will take over from Martin.
While the party’s identity and what it stands for will be a key pillar of discussion, attention will also be paid to the party’s communications, which has been described as poor. This weekend politicians can even avail of social media training, such as how to be “authentic online”.
The motions at any Ard Fheis give an insight into some of the issues that the party’s cummans are concerned about around the country.
This year, there were also motions calling for the establishment of a dedicated Garda Public Transport Unit to tackle antisocial and criminal behaviour on rail, bus and LUAS services – something the Taoiseach has already said he will raise with the justice minister.
Other calls include asking the Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan to renew the grants for window and door replacement, separate to other insulating packages/schemes, so that the general public can afford to upgrade their houses in stages.

There were also calls for the removal of the penalty incurred by people who pay their motor tax in instalments as well as a call for a root and branch review of the ESB, its regulator and our energy regulatory system.

Last night, Martin opened the 80th Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.
In his opening address, he said that there could be no certainty that the war in Ukraine will be over soon, adding that how energy markets will change is largely unknown.
“Urgent action to develop Ireland’s own clean energy industry is not an option – it is a necessity. And we also have to be ready to take more action next year if we have to.
“That’s why it is critical that we have financial reserves in place – and it is also why we are working so closely with other European countries on how to keep prices down, increase supply and protect households and businesses.
“And let there be no doubt, we will not countenance energy firms making huge new profits on the back of this crisis. Action at a European level is progressing fast, and we will add to this with our own actions if they are necessary,” said Martin.
The Taoiseach’s address to the Ard Fheis will be broadcast on RTE at 6.30pm.

THE DEBRIS OF the Northern Ireland Protocol must be “cleared away” if Stormont powersharing institutions are to return, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has insisted.
Donaldson was speaking ahead of a meeting with Taoiseach Micheál Martin later today, and he reiterated the political institutions need the support of unionists as well as nationalists and others.
The Taoiseach is meeting local parties in Belfast as a deadline to restore Stormont and avoid fresh Assembly elections rapidly approaches.
The DUP is blocking the functioning of the powersharing institutions in Belfast as part of its protest against the post-Brexit protocol that has created barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland.
The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either by way of a negotiated compromise with the EU or through proposed domestic legislation that would empower ministers to scrap the arrangements without the approval of Brussels.
Relations between the UK and EU appear to have improved since Liz Truss became prime minister and London and Brussels have been talking up the potential for a deal through fresh negotiations.
Current legislation says that unless Stormont is restored by 28 October, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has to call Assembly elections – something he has said he is prepared to do.
Donaldson said: “We must lay solid foundations if we are to move forward.
“We need to clear away the debris of the protocol years.
“We need to restore cross-community consensus.
“No unionist MLAs support the protocol. Therefore, it must be replaced by arrangements that unionists can support.

“This is essential if the political institutions are to function and succeed.”
The DUP leader also called on Brussels to “loosen the guide ropes” for its negotiating team so problems with the protocol can be discussed and resolved.
He added: “The protocol continues to bedevil us, with businesses and consumers reporting further problems each week.
“A 25% tariff on steel, driving up transport costs by almost 30%, and uncertainty over medicine and veterinary supplies.
“The checks, however, on the Irish Sea border are but a symptom of the problem.
“They are the product of Northern Ireland being subject to a different set of laws imposed upon us by a foreign entity without any say or vote by any locally-elected representative.
“If we can secure a better way forward, then there is a great prize of stable devolved government, but without decisive action in Dublin and Brussels then the protocol will continue to erode the foundations of Stormont.
“Devolution requires the support of unionists as well as nationalists if it is to function and succeed.”
Sinn Féin, which emerged as the largest party in Northern Ireland during Assembly elections earlier this year, has repeatedly called for Stormont to return immediately to address the cost-of-living crisis.
Speaking last week, Sinn Féin Stormont leader Michelle O’Neill said: “We need to get around the executive table today, no more delays. Particularly whenever you see the scale of challenges that we have to tackle as an executive, not least fixing our health service.”
The Taoiseach will hold separate meetings with O’Neill, Donaldson, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long, leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood and Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie.
His programme will conclude with a visit to meet participants in programmes working with schools as catalysts for peace and reconciliation.

The recent apology by Conservative MP Steve Baker over the way the British have treated the Irish over the Northern Ireland’s protocol suggests that London has softened its hard line position.
This has led to speculation that a compromise may be on the cards over changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol that would satisfy the DUP.
If those expected changes such as allowing imported goods from Britain in the North without having to be checked at ports are acceptable, the way could be paved for the DUP to re-enter Stormont with Michelle O’Neill as the First Minister designate.
Failure to reach agreement and the Northern Ireland parties could be going to polls next weeks for the second time in six months.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has weighed in on the controversy surrounding the live crib at Dublin’s Mansion House, saying that there are a “variety of ways” to enjoy Christmas.
The yearly live crib outside the Mansion House was cancelled last week by Green Party Lord Mayor Caroline Conroy, who proposed that the live crib be replaced.
Speaking at the launch of over 70 new social homes in Mulhuddart in Co Dublin, the Taoiseach joked that the controversy unfolding over the decision to cancel the live crib this year was “above my pay grade”.
“I have enjoyed Christmases in the past where we visited live animals,” said Martin, saying that he took his children to see them in Ballina years ago.
“But look, we all have different perspectives. People will have a variety of ways to enjoy Christmas.”
When pressed on whether or not the Lord Mayor should reverse the decision not to hold the live crib outside the Mansion House, the Taoiseach joked: “I think this is above my pay grade.”
There has been controversy caused by the decision to cancel the live crib this Christmas, with the Minister for the Office of Public Works Patrick O’Donovan calling it a “Scrooge-like agenda”.

O’Donovan said he will be working with the IFA on a new location for the crib which attracts thousands of children and their families every Christmas in Dublin.
“Children suffered enough over the last two years having to live with Covid and wondering would Santa and Rudolph manage to get to their homes with lockdowns and restrictions. Let them enjoy this Christmas,” the minister said.
“Let’s have a Nativity crib in the capital city for all children to visit. There cannot be a Scrooge-like agenda from any council for children at Christmas time.”
However, the cancellation of the live crib was welcomed by the National Animal Rights Association (NARA), saying that it was a “progressive step for animal rights”.
The statement, from NARA spokesperson Laura Broxson, said: “Not using animals for entertainment is something that should be welcomed by all as a more compassionate way to mark the festive season.”
“We have been objecting to the ‘live crib’ for over a decade. Farm animals do not belong in Dublin City Centre.
“They’re put in an enclosure, on display, where they have no space to get away from people. They are surrounded by lights, noise and hundreds of people staring at them. In 2022, it’s not an acceptable way to celebrate Christmas.”
O’Donovan said that he is currently working with the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) to find a new location for the live crib.

The Sinn Féin president was pursuing him over what form a Covid inquiry would take – accusing him of trivialising the question and avoiding giving an answer. “I could name seven inquiries that there should be in Northern Ireland about the activities of your movement over the years, but we have never had them,” the Taoiseach said, followed by the kneecapping remark. “There was never any closure.” The record of the...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/sinn-f%C3%A9in-preparing-for-the-return-of-full-throated-post-covid-opposition-1.4794057?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-02-05T04:00:25+00:00,"“Talk to the people in Northern Ireland who were kneecapped for decades,” Micheál Martin shot across the floor of the Dáil last month, taking aim at Mary Lou McDonald. The Sinn Féin president was pursuing him over what form a Covid inquiry would take – accusing him of trivialising the question and avoiding giving an answer.
“I could name seven inquiries that there should be in Northern Ireland about the activities of your movement over the years, but we have never had them,” the Taoiseach said, followed by the kneecapping remark. “There was never any closure.” The record of the Dáil shows this was followed by “interruptions”.
In many ways, it was normal service: Sinn Féin pursuing the Government, which hit back with a reference to the North. But the vivid image of kneecappings summoned in the Dáil by Martin (he has done this before, but not as Taoiseach) was in keeping with increasingly bitter exchanges between the Government and Sinn Féin in recent weeks.
This was most visible during Martin and McDonald’s sharp exchange on the plight of renters when he told her: “Don’t you dare lecture me.”
The Covid emergency put parliamentary politics into a state of suspended animation. With the pandemic hogging the news agenda, there was only occasional room for issues like housing and the cost of living.
On Covid, Sinn Féin largely stuck pretty closely to public health advice. This was a conscious choice, the party’s health spokesman David Cullinane says. “It wasn’t about supporting or opposing the Government on Covid, it was about supporting good public health advice.”
The approach was in line with one of Sinn Féin’s main strategies in Opposition: to impress on voters that it is not simply a party of Opposition for opposition’s sake, angrily attacking every Government policy on every issue just to score points. The wider theme here is that the party is sober-minded, considered and understands policy – in short, that it is ready for government.
Cullinane is a good example of this. Even some Government figures privately concede he has been constructive, and in private briefings with health service officials, conscientious and engaged. It contrasts sharply with the figure who, after being elected in 2020, was recorded addressing a crowd with: “Up the ‘Ra”.
The party attacks were on matters that were mostly peripheral to the main thrust of public health advice: Hepa filters, antigen testing, poor communication and indecision.
Some Sinn Féin actions challenged public health advice: it voted against extending emergency powers and criticised the use of vaccine certs for indoor dining as segregationist. McDonald’s view that pubs should be kept open as the situation deteriorated in the early autumn of 2020 stands out. But by and large, Covid policy was not a battleground issue between the Government and Opposition, and Sinn Féin didn’t treat it as one.
For many in Sinn Féin, the end of the emergency is an opportunity to ram home their advantage by concentrating on bread and butter political issues. In this, there is a view in the party that it is lucky in its enemies as it doesn’t take much to make the failures of the Coalition tangible for voters. One party source admits Sinn Féin’s job is “easy” at present, given the high rents, rising fuel costs and lengthening waiting lists.
Nonetheless, little is left to chance. Behind the scenes, there is an extensive architecture within the party that fine-tunes policy, bolstering the party’s positions in preparation for battle with the Government. Much of the work is done within the offices of spokespersons, but that in turn is reviewed by a central policy unit.
Party policy advisers Miriam Murphy and Shane O’Brien have a key function here, while Pearse Doherty’s office is very powerful. The finance spokesman and deputy leader is adamant that every policy be costed and defensible when it comes to budget time. Doherty is “meticulous”, says a source, convinced that credibility on budgetary matters is key.
Sometimes this can frustrate his colleagues. Speaking privately, one said the political dividend from this is minimal: “We put way too much time on it, they’re obsessed with not making a mistake, but the publicity out of it is zero.”
The extent of dialogue with party officials in the North is, obviously, a topic of much public commentary. Party figures do not deny that policies are cross-checked with Belfast, but say this is for the purposes of cohesion and coherence – that as an all-island party, policies can’t be contradictory. “If we’re going to be saying we want to ban canoes, you liaise with the North and see if they want to ban canoes,” one source explains.
Sinn Féin doesn’t have to grapple with some of the challenges Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael do – in particular, restive and leaky parliamentary party (PP) meetings. While the larger Government parties’ meetings are effectively semi-public, and are used to seed news stories and topical issues, the proceedings of Sinn Féin’s are closely guarded.
“I think what’s happened in Fianna Fáil has been very toxic for them with an almost live-streaming of the PP meetings,” says Cullinane.
Sinn Féin TDs say their own meetings can be robust but are free-flowing enough, with a loose agenda before it is thrown open to the floor. McDonald chairs. (“A lot better than Gerry [Adams]”, one source observed; “Gerry could go rambling around.”)
The meetings can be more charged at moments of political danger for the party. One TD acknowledges that they became heated after the party’s disappointing 2019 local elections, when McDonald’s nascent leadership took a blow, adding: “It wouldn’t be a shock to have a row at meetings.”
However, none of this seeps out. Members are fiercely protective of the privacy of the meetings, saying it’s important that the party has a space where it can debate privately and frankly. Critics point to this iron discipline as evidence that Sinn Féin can be secretive, cloistered and opaque. This is further bolstered by reports from those disaffected from the party, like former TD Peadar Tóibín, that TDs’ assistants are chosen for them. For his part, Cullinane says he had “a say” in choosing his assistant, who was also interviewed by a panel appointed by the party after the position was advertised as part of a “proper, fair process”.
The wider theme, of course, is the charge that Sinn Féin is not a normal party, and that its decision making is trammelled by forces within the wider republican movement. The view of the PSNI and the Garda is that the army council of the Provisional IRA still oversees the party.
The existence of pre-election pledges, signed by candidates, to “be guided and hold myself amenable to all directions and instructions issued to me by An Ard Comhairle of Sinn Féin”, raises further questions of accountability.
Sinn Féin rejects the suggestion that there is anything unusual in its governance structures. A party source who has served on its national officer board and its ard comhairle is adamant: “Nobody ever told me what to do.”
However it does its business, it is clear that Sinn Féin is preparing for the return of full-throated, post-Covid opposition – and, it expects, for government after that.

EU leaders have been meeting today to discuss European security and the fuel crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.
The Taoiseach is in Versailles for the informal EU summit before he heads to London later.
Micheál Martin wants more flexibility on the tax on fuel in the hopes something can be done to cut VAT on petrol and diesel.
Finance Minister and President of the Eurogroup Paschal Donohoe has also joined criticism of potential price gouging on fuel:
Meanwhile the AA says fuel prices have dropped by around 20 cent at many petrol stations in the last 24 hours after the government cut excise duty on petrol and diesel.
Based on a survey at 15 forecourts nationwide, many are selling petrol for around 1.80 a litre and diesel for less than 2 euro.

,"Cost of living: Opposition demands mini-budget, minimum wage increase","Opposition parties are demanding a mini-budget and an increase in the minimum wage to ease the pressure of the cost-of-living crisis. The Social Democrats, Labour and Solidarity-People Before Profit also criticised remarks by Fianna Fáil Minister of State Seán Fleming where he advised people to shop around to get better deals on electricity, insurance and the weekly grocery shop. Senior Government figures, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin, have ruled out a mini-budget as the Government prepares a package of measures to help households with rising bills, particularly for energy. Social...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/cost-of-living-opposition-demands-mini-budget-minimum-wage-increase-1.4796950?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-02-08T14:02:36+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has defended plans to increase Carbon Tax in the face of a call from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald to abandon rises due to kick in this May and criticisms of the Government’s efforts to alleviate the cost-of-living.
The Government has committed to increasing Carbon Tax every year while using the proceeds for environmental initiatives and to alleviate fuel poverty as part of efforts to fight climate change.
While Carbon Tax increases on diesel and petrol began last October a planned increase in the tax on gas, home heating oil and solid fuels due to take place from May 1st.
During Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil on Tuesday Ms McDonald said that households have been “hammered by a cost-of-living crisis that is out of control” and are being “crucified by the extortionate cost of housing, of energy, of fuel, of groceries, of insurance.”
She highlighted remarks by Fianna Fáil Minister of State Seán Fleming - who advised people to shop around to make savings - and claimed they were ""callous and indifferent remarks from a minster who's paid €140,000"".
Ms McDonald argued that the remarks “reflect the attitude of a Government that is utterly out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people”.
She said Sinn Féin has suggested that VAT be removed from energy bill but the Government has not worked with the European Commission to do this.
She also said her party has proposed cutting rents, banning rent increases, cutting childcare costs, expanding eligibility for the fuel allowance and scrapping the planned increase in Carbon Tax which she said would “add to the cost of everything”.
Ms McDonald called on Mr Martin to drop the planned increase in the tax.
Mr Martin defended the Government’s record to support people’s incomes highlighting measures put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic.
He also spoke of the international factors causing an increase in energy costs saying: “This time last year indeed a barrel of oil on international markets traded at $61. Today it’s at $91 a barrel. That wasn’t caused by Carbon Tax, that is a global phenomenon.”
On Sinn Féin’s proposal to cut the VAT rate he said that Ireland currently has a derogation from the EU to have a lower VAT rate of 13.5 per cent.
He said a temporary reduction would mean losing the derogation and the VAT rate could return to 23 per cent “which we do not want to do”.
Mr Martin insisted the Government understands that “people are under significant pressure arising from this inflationary cycle”.
He told the Dáil of more than €1 billion of support of people’s incomes through tax cuts and social protection measures were announced in the Budget.
He said: “Since coming into office the Government has raised fuel allowance from €630 to €914 and if you couple that with the €113.50 electricity payment the Government support for those on low incomes has increased by 63 per cent to €1,027and we’re going to do more.”
Mr Martin cautioned that the Government “can’t chase inflation” as that hasn’t worked previously.
But he said: “We’ve got to cushion the blow... for those most in hardship, those most at risk.
“We’ve got to target the measures and the Government is currently examining ways to do just that. That’s what we intend to do and to alleviate people more generally in terms of these pressures.”
He said the the Government has a number of measures under consideration and indicated that they would be announced later this week.
Ms McDonald accused the Government of “mañana, mañana” and “dither and delay” and reiterated her call for the increase in Carbon Tax to be scrapped.
Mr Martin said that around €146 million in measures to help families in the last Budget was funded by raising Carbon Tax and that around €200 million this year will come from those receipts to fund the retrofitting of homes for energy efficiency.
He said the receipts from Carbon Tax are “going back to the people in terms of better environmental farming practices... retrofitting their houses so that they’re more efficient energy wise and ultimately to reduce costs.
“And they’ll also go towards fuel poverty and that’s why we allocated it towards fuel poverty in the Budget.”
Earlier, opposition parties had demanded a mini-budget and an increase in the minimum wage to ease the pressure of the cost-of-living crisis.
The Social Democrats, Labour and Solidarity-People Before Profit also criticised remarks by Mr Fleming where he advised people to shop around to get better deals on electricity, insurance and the weekly grocery shop.
Senior Government figures, including Mr Martin, had ruled out a mini-budget as the Government prepares its package of measures to help households with rising bills, particularly for energy.
Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said: “Tinkering at the edges is not going to deal with this.
“If you’re going to do something that is targeted and meaningful, I think it is probably going to be in the area of a mini-budget.”
She suggested measures, such as an increased minimum wage and extending the fuel allowance for people on the working family payment scheme, were needed to help workers on lower incomes.
She claimed Mr Fleming's comments were ""insulting"" and they ""really fall into the Marie Antoinette category"".
Labour TD Ged Nash claimed that to date the Government ""has only introduced two proposals"".
He said the first is €113 off electricity bills and he labelled this as a “gimmick” and the second was Mr Fleming’s suggestion that people should “stop complaining and they should shop around”.
Mr Nash argued that this is ""very telling and reveals a poverty of imagination from Government in respect of how they plan to deal with this unprecedented crisis for working families across the country.""
Mr Nash said comprehensive changes are needed to the social welfare and finance Bills and he gave the example of a VAT cut on fuel and energy costs.
He said a mini-budget should be implemented “if the package that is to be presented is going to be meaningful”.
Solidarity TD Mick Barry said he will be introducing a Dáil motion on Wednesday calling for an increase in the minimum wage to €15 per hour.
He said it must fully compensate low-paid workers not just taking into account rate of inflation “but how it impacts on them disproportionately”.
Mr Barry also claimed that Mr Fleming’s remarks shows that Government Ministers are “out of touch with the reality for working people in this cost-of-living crisis”.
Mr Fleming has apologised for his comments on RTÉ Radio's Drivetime show.
During an interview in which he sought to reign in expectations about the package of measures the Government is preparing he also said: “So rather than just complaining and saying, ‘What’s the Government going to do for me?’ You could actually have a serious impact on your own finances.”
When challenged by Drivetime presenter Sarah McInerney, Mr Fleming argued the targets of his criticism were opposition TDs, and that it “would be more practical” to give people suggestions.
Mr Fleming released a statement late last night saying: “I did not intend to imply people shouldn’t complain about the cost of living, that wasn’t my intention and for that I apologise. I was urging people to also shop around for best value, in addition to the measures being taken by the Government.”
He insisted: “The Government and Fianna Fáil take the issues around the cost of living very seriously.”

THE TAOISEACH HAS warned of “rocky” times ahead for consumers due to higher fuel prices after the EU slapped fresh sanctions on Russian oil and gas.
Micheál Martin said Europe is entering a “different era” of fossil fuel pricing due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Martin said the government will do everything it can to “alleviate the pressures” on Irish consumers.
The leaders of the 27 EU member states yesterdayagreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports into the bloc by year-endas part of the sixth round of EU sanctions.
The compromise move covers Russian oil brought in by sea, allowing a temporary exemption for imports delivered by pipeline.
Speaking in Brussels today, Martin said he is very pleased that the decision was taken by EU leaders, describing it as a “watershed moment” for EU consumption of fossil fuels.
“It’s a significant decision in terms of the banning of the importation of Russian oil into the European Union and really accounting for a very significant volume of Russian oil and that will hit Russia,” the Taoiseach said.
Martin said there’s no doubt in his mind that creating an energy and food crisis is part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategy to secure victory in Ukraine.
“It is a watershed moment in terms of fossil fuels in general, which will make for fairly rocky territory over the next number of years in terms of pricing around fossil fuels, we cannot get away from that,” Martin said.

“We will do everything we can to alleviate the pressures on consumers. But if you look at the EU power initiative and communication it is very, very clear that if you reduce permanently your dependence on Russian gas and oil, that has implications for the global market over time.
Renewable energy
Martin said it is clear from the EU Commission meeting that European nations, including Ireland, need to “double down” on producing renewable energy.
He said Ireland has performed well regarding developing renewable energy infrastructure but it now needs to “speed up the delivery of offshore wind projects.
“That’s the big game changer for Ireland over the next decade, no doubt about that. Because that ultimately, by the mid 2030s, would enable Ireland to become an exporter, as opposed to a chronic importer of fossil fuels,” the Taoiseach concluded.
Wage increases needed now
People Before Profit Mick Barry noted the comments made by the Taoiseach today that people can expect to see higher energy bills.
“That really underlines the need for decent wages. Th Tánaiste says he will bring proposals to Cabinet in June with what he describes as a roadmap for a living wage. We will we will be making the point that the figure of €12.90 for a living wage was established in advance of the inflation crisis. In advance of a situation where people regularly were being asked for €2,500 or more for a month’s rent,” he said.
Barry said that €15 an hour is the figure that should be the minimum wage given the current cost of living crisis.
“We’ll be raising this in the Dail this week and we’ll also be saying clearly to the government, the idea of time lag or a time delay in this is not acceptable to us.
“Landlords won’t accept time delays in paying the rent, the supermarkets won’t accept the time delay in paying the grocery bills. Workers need wage increases, we need a living wage, and we need it now,” he added.

Micheál Martin said current projections see the economy continuing to grow, but cautioned the international situation is highly uncertain.
The State does not have an estimate for how much the war will cost from a financial point of view, and Mr Martin said Ireland entering recession is something which cannot be completely ruled out.
“I can never promise anybody about economic cycles,” he told reporters from Washington DC.
“We’re an open exporting economy, and so we export to markets like the United States, like the European Union, that are big markets for us.
“If they come under pressure, invariably our companies don’t sell as much in terms of European consumers and industry and so on.”
The Taoiseach also said Ireland will not be sending military supplies or aid to Ukraine, following Ukrainian President Volodomir Zelensky's address to the US congress.
“Ireland is not a military power. Let’s call a spade a spade, we’re not a military power,” Mr Martin said.
“Our greatest strength is in the humanitarian side, our greatest strength is in the peacekeeping side to be frank, that’s what we do well, and also in terms of giving any supplies we can - which we have.”
As he continues his four-day visit to the United States for St Patrick’s Day celebrations, Mr Martin’s meeting with US Vice President Kamala Harris has been cancelled after her husband tested positive for Covid-19. He will meet with President Joe Biden tomorrow.

The Taoiseach was already at the Ireland Funds Gala in Washington, DC on Wednesday night when his positive test came through.
According toRTE, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was about to present the Taoiseach with an award, however, Ireland's Ambassador to the US Dan Mulhall stepped on stage and announced that the Taoiseach had tested positive.

Ireland and the United States are working together. For the first time, now, they are on the security council. Ireland’s part of the [United Nations] security council now.”

Tomorrow, Biden is due to speak by phone to China’s presidentXi Jinpingfor the first time since its neighbor and, typically, ally invaded Ukraine.
At the St. Patrick's lunch on Capitol Hill, President Biden notes he'll be speaking to President Xi tomorrow, calls President Putin a ""murderous dictator"" and ""pure thug"" and says the Kremlin is waging ""an immoral war"" against the people of Ukraine.
Thank you for joining the US politics live blog on (yet) another busy day in Washington DC, and around the world. The Guardian’s ongoing live coverage of the war in Ukraine can be foundhere.
Here’s what happened today:
The White House press secretary was also questioned about secretary of state Antony Blinken’s backing ofBiden’s assertionon Wednesday that Putin is a war criminal.
Psaki said the administration would be “supporting efforts” to investigate Russia’s actions with partners worldwide.
“Secretary Blinken gave some specifics about who from the state department will be leading that effort,” she said.
“It’s a legal process, where they review all of the evidence and then they provide that evidence and data and information to the international bodies that oversee the investigations. We would make determinations about violation of international law and whether it’s war crimes by their standards, and what the consequences would be.”
Psaki said Russia’s response to Biden’s war criminal comment, calling it “unforgivable rhetoric” was “pretty rich, coming from a country whose actions are unforgivable.”
“Whether it’s the destruction of a theater where the words children or kids was written in Russian outside, or whether it’s targeting civilians in maternity wards, if that’s not considered a war crime by human beings, what is?” she said.
Psaki addressed Biden’s scheduled call with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday, and says the factRussiais asking for military help from China “is a clear sign that this war is not going how President Putin planned for it to go.”
She said the Biden-Xi call was “mutually agreed upon” and it would address Russia’s request.
“China assisting, in any way, Russia as they invade a foreign country, is a significant concern,” she said, adding that any consequences for China if it did so would be discussed during the call.
But she said it was not yet clear that China would grant Putin’s request.
“They abstained from a vote in the [United Nations] security council. But they also echoed some of the conspiracy theories about chemical weapons and US and Ukrainian intentions. So for any country, it’s a question of where you want to be as the history books are written.”
White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s daily briefing is under way,seemingly delayed by secretary of state Antony Blinken’s remarks about Russia’s targeting of civilian targets inUkraine.
The early discussion is over Covid-19, and the “historic milestone” of the US delivering 500m vaccines, reaching 113 countries worldwide.
“It’s something that’s never been done before. We didn’t get here by accident,” Psaki says, calling on Congress to provide additional funding to “turn vaccines into vaccinations.”
Joe Biden was not tested today for Covid-19, Psaki says, because his encounter with Irish prime minister Micheal Martin on Wednesday - who has tested positive - was not long enough for him to be considered a close contact.
Arnold Schwarzenegger has delivered his backing toUkrainein a nine-minute video the movie star and former California governor posted on Thursday to his Twitter account.
“I love the Russian people. That’s why I have to tell you the truth. Please watch and share,” Schwarzenegger saysin the tweetaccompanying his video, which had already amassed more than a quarter-million likes by Thursday lunchtime.

Starting with a tale about meeting his hero, the world champion Russian weightlifterYuri Petrovich Vlasov, in Vienna when he was a 14-year-old, Schwarzenegger goes on to explain his deepening affection and admiration for the kindness of the Russian people.
Addressing in turn Russian citizens, troops and the country’s leadership, he says he is speaking with the same “heartfelt concern” with which hespoke to the American peopleafter the 6 January insurrection last year.
“Moments like this are so wrong, and then we have to speak up,” Schwarzenegger says.
“Your government has told you this is a war to de-Nazify Ukraine. This is not true. Ukraine is a country with a Jewish president whose father’s three brothers were all murdered by the Nazis.
“Ukraine did not start this war. Neither did nationalists or the Nazis. Those in power in the Kremlin started this war. This is not the Russian people’s war.”
Austria-born Schwarzenegger tells the story of how his father, who fought for Germany in the second world war, was left broken by his experiences of the battle of Leningrad, in which he was wounded. He goes on to tell Russian soldiers that they have been lied to, and that thousands of them have already been killed.
“Some were told the Ukrainian people would treat them like heroes. Some were told they were simply going on exercises. They didn’t even know they were going to war,” he says.
The video concludes with Schwarzenegger pointing out that 11m Russians have family connections to Ukraine.
“Every bullet you shoot, you shoot a brother or sister,” he says.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is talking now in Washington and has said he agreed with whatJoe Bidenexpressed yesterday, that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.
Blinken said that Russia’s air attacks on the theater, where the word “children” had been painted in huge letters outside, on people waiting in a bread line, on a maternity hospital are incidents that “join a long line of attacks on civilian locations in Ukraine”, echoing past merciless civilian bombardment by Russian might inGrozny, Chechnya, andAleppo, Syria, where “the goal is breaking the will of the people”.
Yesterday, Joe Biden said he thinks the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is a war criminal.
“Personally, I agree with him,” Blinken just said.
He added: “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”
He also warned that Putin may be “setting the stage” to unleash chemical weapons onUkraineand, as a “false flag” event, blame it on Ukraine instead.
It’s been a busy day so far, with the US political landscape dominated by foreign affairs, with focus on US-news related to Russia’s war inUkraine. We’ll have more coming up.
Meanwhile, it if you want to follow our global, round-the-clock blog on the war in Ukraine itself, that ishere.
Here’s where things stand in the US:
Joe Biden slammed Russian presidentVladimir Putinas a “murderous dictator” and a “pure thug” when he spoke before a St Patrick’s Day lunch on Capitol Hill just earlier.
The US president was fresh from a virtual meeting with the Covid-struck Irish taoiseach, or prime minister, Micheál Martin, at the White House.
He then spoke prior to a Friends of Ireland lunch at the Capitol hosted by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
Biden said: “Now you have Ireland and Great Britain ... standing together against a murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people ofUkraine... Ireland and the United States are working together. For the first time, now, they are on the security council. Ireland’s part of the [United Nations] security council now.”

Tomorrow, Biden is due to speak by phone to China’s presidentXi Jinpingfor the first time since its neighbor and, typically, ally invaded Ukraine.
At the St. Patrick's lunch on Capitol Hill, President Biden notes he'll be speaking to President Xi tomorrow, calls President Putin a ""murderous dictator"" and ""pure thug"" and says the Kremlin is waging ""an immoral war"" against the people of Ukraine.
Joe Biden’s St Patrick’s Day in-person celebration plan in the Oval Office was scuppered by the absence of theCovid-strickenIrish taoiseach Micheál Martin.
But the two leaders, both wearing green ties and sprigs of shamrock on their lapels, spoke virtually to discuss their mutual support for Ukraine, and the president’s commitment to theGood Friday agreementthat came out of the Northern Ireland peace process in the 1990s.
Biden, who has abetter argument than most of his predecessorsto claim Irish ancestry, had also arranged fresh shamrocks in a crystal bowl on his desk and several other spots in preparation for the meeting. He said he was deeply sorry that Martin had to appear on a television screen again, following the pair’sprevious St Patrick’s Day meetingin cyberspace one year ago.
The conversation witnessed by the pool reporter was brief, the leaders praising each other for their support ofUkraine, and Martin hailing Biden for uniting western nations against Russian aggression.
“It’s extremely important that we keep this unity of purpose,” Martin said.
Today, the White House is proud to continue the tradition of a vibrant green fountain for St. Patrick’s Day. ☘️pic.twitter.com/ZAaqxTV7IL
Biden later attended a Friends of Ireland lunch at the Capitol hosted by House speaker Nancy Pelosi, at which he riffed about a family tour of Ireland and praised the collaboration between the nations.
“The relationship between Ireland and the United States is a dynamic and essential partnership as much as it’s ever been,” Biden said.
“The connections that link our peoples stretch back through history and we share a common goal for the future of greater peace, greater hope, greater security, and a greater sense of who we are as a country.”
Deadly Switchblade drones, with the capability of delivering warheads at a range from six to more than 20 miles, will be among shipments of US arms to Ukraine as part of Joe Biden’s $800m aid package announced Wednesday,CNN is reporting.
Two sources said to have knowledge of the matter told the network that the drones were added to the assistance package following discussions betweenUkraineofficials and US Congressional partners at the weekend.
It was not specified if the drones would be the smaller Switchblade 300 model, which can reach targets up to six miles distant, according to the manufacturers, the defense contractorAeroVironment, or the longer-range Switchblade 600. CNN said both models are: “small, portable so-called kamikaze or suicide drones that carry a warhead and detonate on impact.”
Training of the Ukraine military in using the drones could be performed remotely, the network said.
At a press conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, on Thursday morning, the US defense secretaryLloyd Austinsaid drones had proven “very effective” against Russia’s “unjust and unprovoked invasion.”
“Our goal has been to continue to reinforce those things that have worked for the Ukrainian forces,” he said.
AeroVironment did not respond to a request for comment, but a message on its website said the company: “Stands with the people of Ukraine and all of Nato.”
Lloyd Austin was asked at his press conference in Slovakia if Russia is engaged in war crimes inUkraine.
He said: “Well, certainly we have all been shocked by the brutality that we continue to witness day in and day out and these attacks that we’ve seen most recently appear to be focused directly on civilians.
“And of course that, you know, if you attack civilians purposely, if you target civilians purposely, then that’s, that is a crime. So these actions are under review by our State Department and of course there is a process that we’ll go through to review all this but we call upon Mr Putin to cease these horrible actions.
“Again, these are civilians and not combatants and so they should not be targeted.”
Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, is in Bratislava, Slovakia, and held a presser with his Slovakian counterpart, defense minister Jaroslav Nad.
Another journalist asked about the option of supplying S-300 systems toUkraine, the Soviet-designed, long-range surface-to-air missile system.
Austin said: “What has been successful for the Ukrainian forces is that they’ve been able to really preventRussiafrom establishing air supremacy and they have done through effective use of air defense systems, both medium-range and short-range systems.”
Ordinary observers are probably a bit surprised to hear him say that Russia has not established air supremacy when it’s bombarding Ukraine from the air in ruthless fashion. Zelenskiy also clearly thinks that there is, indeed, more in Nato’s power that it could do. And more weapons are under discussion, as we’ve written.
However, Austin continued: “So our goal has been to continue to reinforce those things that have worked for the Ukrainian forces. So we are talking to a number of our allies and partners to get as much capability as we can to continue to provide help.”
Austin is asked about the long-range missile systems Russia is using to attack Ukraine and what he is discussing with allies about alternatives to the S-300 system, in order to help Ukraine in “the long-range arena”.
Austin said: “The systems that are being used by the Russians...they are using a lot of rockets, missiles and artillery. There are a number of things that can be used to counter that. We see that drones have been very effective, we’ve also seen that having the ability to conduct counter-fire with rockets and artillery is also very effective so I think increasingly we’ll see the Ukrainian forces turn to those methods to counter that.”
“The rockets, or actually cruise missiles, that you mentioned are fired from aerial platforms, I think you know that those were fired actually from inside of Russia so a no-fly zone would not have prevented that activity.”
Nad said supplying S-300 systems is being discussed and there is a willingness as long as there’s backfill to ensure the security of Nato and the individual members’ territories by replacing the systems given to Ukraine.
Bernie Sanders knows who he would like as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2024 if Joe Biden doesn’t run,according to Politico.
Senior aides to theprogressive Vermont senator, who failed to win the party’s nomination in each of the last two elections, are “privately encouraging” the California congressmanRo Khannato run, the website says, adding that they have held preliminary discussions.
Publicly at least, Khanna, 45, has ruled out the possibility, in keeping with the tradition of not challenging or undermining an incumbent first-term president.
But Biden, who has said heintends to seek a second-term, will be 81 at the next election, and more than half of registered voters do not expect him to run, according to a pollreported by CNNthis week.
Speculation is already swirling in Democratic circles over Biden’s successor, especially with vice-president Kamala Harris’sless-than-stellar approval ratings.
Khanna is among a younger, progressive group of Democrats in the House. He is a Yale law school graduate elected to Congress in 2016, and chairs the House subcommittee on the environment. He sits on the House armed services, agriculture and oversight and reform committees.
“I think Ro would be a very effective candidate,”Mark Longabaugh, senior adviser to Sanders in 2016, told Politico, stressing he was talking only about a scenario in which Biden did not run.
“This guy has a message that’s very powerful.”
Lloyd Austin, theUS defense secretary, is in Slovakia for a meeting ofNatoministers and has just held a press conference at which he reiterated and further explained why the US will not support imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to hold off Russian air attacks.
“We are working urgently with our partners in the Ukrainian armed forces to further strengthen their capabilities to defend themselves. “We take our obligations to Nato and to our allies very seriously and our commitment to article five [the Nato agreement that provides that an attack on one member is an attack on all and should be defended as such] is iron clad.
“We’ve sent additional US forces to reinforce our Nato allies and we have more on call, ready to go if Nato activates its response forces … to enhance Europe’s defenses.”
He referred to Putin’s war on choice and its unprovoked invasion ofUkraine, just over three weeks ago.
Then in questions from the gathered media, Austin was asked by a Slovakian television journalist whether Nato will agree to repeated requests from Ukraine’s president,Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to impose a military no-fly zone over Ukraine in an attempt to halt Russia’s aerial bombardment.
He said: “From a US perspective … President Biden has been clear that we would not have US forces fighting in Ukraine. Having said that we will do everything in our power to support Ukraine ... [but] enforcing a no-fly zone means that you are in combat, you are in a fight with Russia and that’s one of the things we have said, our president has said we are not going to do.
“So what this really means is that in order to control the skies you have to shut down the air defenses that are on the ground, and some of those air defense systems are in Russia and so again there is no easy or simple way to do this.
“There is no such thing as a no-fly zone ‘lite’, a no-fly zone means that you are in a conflict with Russia. So from a US perspective, our position remains that we are not going to do that.”
Here’s more about those internal political divisions facingJoe Bidenover Ukraine.
Democratic senatorsDick Durbinof Illinois andMark Kellyof Arizona are among those urging caution in the level of assistance the president should provide, with Kelly telling local media that too much coulddraw the US into a direct conflictwith Russia.
Both opposed transferring Polish Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, and alsoNatoimposing a no-fly zone over the country that have been repeatedly requested by its presidentVolodymyr Zelenskiy, including during hiscaptivating address to the US Congresson Wednesday.
But the Democratic Senate majority leaderChuck Schumer ofNew York and senior senatorRichard Blumenthalof Connecticut are among several colleagues who openly support the proposed transfer, joining severalRepublicanswho say the Biden administration needs to be doing more.
“I think there’s a clear distinction that avoids escalation and at the same time enables the Ukrainians to have a fair fight on the ground,” Blumenthal told a gathering of Capitol Hill reporters on Wednesday.
Biden is on a tightrope, havingsaid no to sending the jets, and rejecting Zelenskiy’s no-fly zone appeal. But he announced an additional $800m in support to Ukraine on Wednesday, including military drones and surface-to-air missiles. The US has alreadycommitted $13.6bnin aid.
Predictability, the Republican Senate minority leaderMitch McConnellof Kentuckysays the administration needs to be doing much more.
“Our own president needs to step up his game,” he said following Zelenskiy’s address to Congress,according to Insider. “We’re not doing nearly enough, quickly enough to help the Ukrainians. President Biden needs to step up his game right now, before it’s too late.”
Meanwhile, Moscow is fuming over Biden callingRussia’s presidentVladimir Putin“a war criminal”for his military’s attacks on civilians.
Moscow branded Biden’s comment “unforgivable rhetoric.” Here’sa handy explaineron what constitutes a war crime, and who gets to decide who is, or isn’t, a war criminal.
Good morning, happy St Patrick’s Day, and welcome to Thursday’s US politics live blog.Joe Bidenis facing divisions inside his own party, and more criticism fromRepublicans, over his approach to the Ukraine crisis prompted by Russia’s invasion.
Opinions are sharply divided in Washington DC over how much military aid Biden should send toUkraine.

,The Irish Times view on Irish foreign policy: standing with Ukraine,"‘Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy, but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be.’’ In recalling John F Kennedy’s words to the Dáil in 1963, Simon Coveney yesterday echoed Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s call for what the Minister for Foreign Affairs called a “reflection” on our policy of military neutrality: “On how it has evolved and what it means, at a time when so many of our assumptions have been overturned, and in which the growth of hybrid and cyber warfare means that geography no longer dictates our security and defence...",https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/the-irish-times-view-on-irish-foreign-policy-standing-with-ukraine-1.4823334?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-03-10T07:03:04+00:00,"'Ireland pursues an independent course in foreign policy, but it is not neutral between liberty and tyranny and never will be.'' In recalling John F Kennedy's words to the Dáil in 1963, Simon Coveney yesterday echoed Taoiseach Micheál Martin's call for what the Minister for Foreign Affairs called a ""reflection"" on our policy of military neutrality: ""On how it has evolved and what it means, at a time when so many of our assumptions have been overturned, and in which the growth of hybrid and cyber warfare means that geography no longer dictates our security and defence calculations.""
It would not necessarily involve joining Nato, he argued, but the crisis gave added meaning to the strengthening of military co-operation within the EU. For Ireland that meant enhancing the interoperability of troops and assisting in developing security capabilities like cyber warfare which a small country could not tackle on its own.
Speaking to the Institute of International and European Affairs in an annual report on the thrust of Irish foreign policy, Coveney insisted that Ireland stands “unambiguously and unapologetically with Ukraine”.
""We are not politically neutral when it comes to a crisis like this,"" he said, paying an emotional tribute to the courage of ""the people of Ukraine, whose history is being written today, who are showing such extraordinary courage in their determination to define their own future"".
This is “a historical moment, a historical test” for Ireland and, 50 years since it joined, for the EU, whose Ukrainian membership Ireland supports. The union’s united and powerful response “mark a watershed moment for the EU, demonstrating the EU’s credibility as a political actor with economic weight that it can bring significant pressure to bear in a crisis”.
Coveney’s pledge that Ireland’s State and people would not be found wanting – on refugees, he promised that “there is no target on how many people we will support” – is welcome. There will be a hefty cost, he admitted, but it is one the country must be prepared to pay.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said it’s “possible” that Irish Defence Force personnel would be sent to the Ukrainian border to help with the escalating humanitarian crisis as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Taoiseach was speaking to reporters in Versailles ahead of an informal two-day summit of the European Council, of which France holds the presidency of until June.
The summit is to be dominated by discussions on Ukraine, the ongoing humanitarian crisis as over a million Ukrainians flee their country, the issue of further sanctions and how to grapple with hikes in energy costs.
When asked would there be any circumstances in which Irish Defence Forces personnel would go to areas around the Ukrainian border to help with humanitarian aid, the Taoiseach said “that’s always possible”.
“We have the triple-lock [system] which basically means that Government approval [and Dáil approval], along with a UN resolution, then enables Irish troops to serve in peacekeeping or peace enforcement.”
He cited the Lebanon as such areas where Irish troops serve for peacekeeping purposes.
But to get UN authorisation, all five permanent members of its Security Council need to agree – that includes China and Russia, as well as France, Britain and the US.
When asked how Ireland would take part in any discussions on whether to send further military weapons to Ukraine given our neutral military stance, the Taoiseach said that “we have made our contribution”.
“We took a constructive abstention approach on that, in terms of deployment of the European Peace Facility, which has already allowed €450 million to be spent in terms of Europe sending lethal weapons.

“We have made our full contribution, and our contribution is in that part of the deployment which is for non-lethal.
“And that was something we had worked on prior to the establishment of the peace facility within the European Union to facilitate countries with specific characteristics such as ours in terms of neutrality and we wouldn’t prevent others and prevent the Union as a bloc from helping citizens in a situation like this to defend themselves.”
The Taoiseach, who was wearing a blue and yellow ribbon, said that the summit would be emotional, as Ukraine enters its third week of fighting the Russian invasion.
“It will be emotional in the sense that all prime ministers are very well aware of the enormous human impact of this war on the people.
“We pay tribute to the journalists of the world who are bringing those photographs to us, risking their lives to get in behind the scenes.
“I pay tribute to the President of France Emmanuel Macron for keeping the channels of communication open with Vladimir Putin to get this war ended, and that’s the most important, to get the war ended.”
It’s been reported that the EU could impose another round of sanctions against Russia, already the most sanctioned country in the world, over its invasion of Ukraine two weeks ago.
This will not be decided at this summit, the Taoiseach said, as it is an informal summit of leaders – but added that it will be discussed.
“Sanctions will be kept under constant review, again. The interaction between the European Union, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, my basic principle is that we should have unity of purpose on this, and we should move in unison.
“Because that’s the greatest impact and has the greatest impact in terms of pressure on Russia. But again, we will believe there will be some discussion of that today.”

I was delighted when Ireland offered unlimited visa-free access to Ukrainians. And I have been hugely encouraged by recent statements from Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. In short, I am proud of Ireland’s response, but feel we must go further.
It is in this context that I find Una Mullally's vitriolic and overly personalised attack (""Ukraine crisis will not be solved by macho posturing against Irish neutrality"",Opinion,March 14th) on Neale Richmond TD both unsavoury and unhelpful.
I have no politics in Ireland where I have not lived for 34 years but I can say that through the difficulties of Brexit and now horrors of Russia’s invasion, Mr Richmond is increasingly a powerful voice for Ireland on the international stage.
As someone who has increasingly advocated across the media for the West to do more to stop the emerging genocide in Ukraine, I particularly support his idea of simply donating Ireland’s 100 Javelins to Ukraine. In skilled Ukrainian hands they will kill, maybe, 100 more Russian tanks and save innocent Ukrainian lives. And having done this, Ireland should then look at providing military funding as Mr Richmond has also suggested.
This is the first time since 1939 we have seen a conflict that is so clearly delineated between good and evil. But this is not 1939 and Ireland is not an impoverished nation on its knees; we are today one of the wealthiest (per capita) and most sophisticated countries on earth and with a global ability to punch far above our weight.
Ireland cannot have a pick-and-mix approach to neutrality in what will be a defining moment for security in Europe.
It is important now that Ireland not only does everything the State can to support Ukraine in her existential war but also should provide international leadership that will help galvanise our partners at this precarious time for all of us.

CORMAC SMITH,

Sir, – Una Mullally (Opinion, March 14th) strangely makes a personalised attack on Neale Richmond for raising the issue of our neutrality. Mr Richmond has called for a long-overdue, serious, and realistic conversation about what our neutrality means in practice.
Mullally is however correct in raising my party’s record in this area. In 1941, future Fine Gael leader James Dillon courageously said in Dáil Éireann: “It may be the policy of this government to stand neutral, but I am not neutral. I pray Germany and its rulers may be smashed by the Anglo-American alliance.” – Yours, etc,
Cllr DAVID McMANUS,
Fine Gael group leader,
South Dublin Co Council,
Tallaght, Dublin 24.
Sir, – An Irishman such as Alan Shatter calling for a no-fly zone over Ukraine is a shameless hypocrisy – enforcement of which calls for an airforce to shoot down Russians; an act of war which will inevitably escalate (""West must call Putin's bluff and impose no-fly zone over Ukraine,Opinion, March 14th). It will play into Putin's hands. Does Shatter want to fight to the last American?
– Yours, etc,

Biden was supposed to host Martin for a day of festivities, but those events have been reimagined as the Irish leader isolates at Blair House across the street from the White House.
The two leaders will hold a virtual bilateral meeting and Martin will sit out the annual “Friends of Ireland Luncheon” at the Capitol that Biden will attend.
Biden will go ahead with a White House reception planned for Thursday evening, but Martin will not attend.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he is hopeful that advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) will be that restrictions can be eased at the end of January.
Speaking to reporters this morning, he said the government will be looking at the possible easing of restrictions for hospitality, allowing cultural events and hospitality sectors to trade beyond 8pm.
Current restrictions are in place until 30 January.
“We’ll be looking looking at hospitality and obviously the 8pm restriction as well,” he said.

Progress has been made in respect of Omicron and despite it being very transmissible, it is not translating into hospitalisations and ICU admissions on the same scale as previous waves, said the Taoiseach.
A new reviewhas found that just 42% of patients in hospital with the disease have Covid-19 symptoms and almost three-quarters are not receiving oxygen therapy.
Martin paid tribute to the cultural and hospitality sector for showing a high degree of “tolerance and forbearance” in recent weeks, adding they have “kept with it” by putting on performances during the day and showing innovation around the restrictions.
“The restrictions are very severe,” Martin acknowledged.
“There will be a meeting of NPHET next week and I would hope that we will be in a position to to move forward in terms of the current restrictions, but I’m not in a position to say anything definitive,” he added, stating that he will await to hear what the public health experts say next week.
Case numbers seem to be levelling off, said the Taoiseach.

“So we are hopeful in terms of the progress we’ve made to date,” he said.
Speaking in Kildare this afternoon, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the government is focusing now less on cases and more on hospitalisations and the numbers in ICU.
He said he would like to see those numbers falling before easing restrictions.
NPHET are due to meet next Thursday. Varadkar said businesses will be told what will happen in February well in advance.

No definitive figure has been provided for those who died in the war which lasted from June 1922 to May 1923.
The best estimates are approximately 1,300, according to the historian James Durney, made up of 730 National Army, 350 IRA and 200 civilians. The IRA dead included 81 men executed by the Government between September 1922 and May 1923.
The plan for a single State ceremony to remember the Civil War was recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations.
It will be included in the full Decade of Centenaries programme which the Minister for Culture Catherine Martin will bring before the Cabinet presently.
A national conference on the Civil War will be held in University College Cork between June 15th-18th.
Speaking at a conference to mark the centenary of the handing over of Dublin Castle, the Taoiseach said the transfer of power from the British to the new Irish administration was a “once unthinkable success for Irish nationalism and republicanism”.
However, by the time the Irish Free State came formally into being in December 1922 it “faced divisions and challenges many times more serious than it faced in January” as the country was enmeshed in a bloody civil war.
Mr Martin said the seeds of the tragedy which occurred in Ireland with the Civil War was caused in part by the elongated nature of the British handover which meant that British troops were still in Ireland throughout much of 1922.
""The great failure of 1922 is the number of times when opportunities to at least look for common ground were spurned. Only limited and temporary efforts were undertaken to de-escalate. A momentum built which was subsequently portrayed as inevitable, but there is no reason to believe that other outcomes were not possible,"" he said.
“Through most of the year, and especially at critical times, London and its representatives in Dublin acted in an inflexible way which both limited the provisional government’s options and reinforced divisions.
“The approach to the Treaty text was, as it had been during the negotiations, about insisting that nothing more could possibly be done.
“It is hard not to wonder if some way back from conflict could have been found if there had actually been a cleaner break on January 16th.”
Mr Martin pointed out that the Anglo-Irish Treaty did not create partition, but its implementation did reinforce the division on the island.
Partition was not an issue in the Treaty debates because most deputies expected that the Northern Irish state was simply unsustainable – or would be as soon as the Boundary Commission had done its work. ""Nobody claimed that it would be or should be permanent,"" he maintained.
Mr Martin said after the Treaty “in almost every way possible bad faith was shown toward the nationalist majority on this island when it came to addressing partition in 1922 and the years following”.
The Council of Ireland set up by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which was supposed to facilitate co-operation between North and South, was never implemented.
The Boundary Commission, which was supposed to return nationalist-majority areas to the Irish Free State “refused to even consider significant action. While county boundaries had been used to create the border, other approaches were used to block obvious changes to it.
“London’s indifference [to] the reality of the sectarianism faced by Northern nationalists also caused immense damage.
“Partition became a regular part of the pattern of later acceptances of independence, and the parallels with Ireland are unmistakable.
“For the majority, it was a deep and lasting shock to see a divide introduced where they had, until very recently, never considered one to be possible. Their churches, unions, sporting organisations, legislators and much more had never before been divided in this way.
“Even for many unionists this was an unnatural divide which I believe is rightly seen as shaping much of our subsequent history – and not for the good.”
Speaking at the conference organised by Trinity College Dublin, Ms Martin said she is committed to ensuring that the final phase of the Decade of Centenaries programme ""will be inclusive and collaborative to the greatest extent possible"".
The handover of Dublin Castle on January 16th, 1922, will be marked on Sunday with the first State commemoration since the pandemic started.
President Michael D Higgins, Mr Martin and other members of the Government will be in attendance.
Attendance will also include representatives of the Dáil and Seanad Éireann, the diplomatic corps, judiciary, local government, Northern Ireland representatives and descendants of key figures of the time.
Aontú leader Peadar Tóibin said he will not attend the event as the Treaty was a “ disaster for hundreds of thousands of Irish people who still live with its consequences today. As the day is marked, lets not erase the catastrophe that resulted for Northern nationalists.”

People felt sorry for Micheál Martin when a positive Covid test nixed his Oval Office meeting with President Joe Biden and the subsequent St Patrick's Day hooleys.
Even Mary Lou McDonald – also in Washington, and very much presenting herself as the leader of the Opposition and so the potential next taoiseach – was tweeting him sympathy and good wishes. With Martin due to vacate the Taoiseach's Office at the end of this year, it's hard to imagine that there will be another opportunity for him to bump fists in the White House.
So the Taoiseach's disappointment is understandable, even if he bore up manfully: 'It's not the end of the world,' he said. For the rest of us, however, it is neither here nor there: what matters are the results that he can achieve
Despite a hectic schedule of meetings, media interviews (including with the editorial board of the Washington Post), round tables and social events, Martin was clearly enjoying himself in the sunshine in Washington. Taoisigh always do. They are feted and fluffed for a week in what is, after all, the world capital of politics and treated with a deference that is not always, shall we say, accorded them at home. And they are celebrated by the awesome political machine that is Irish America. It is not for nothing that the Washington trip is regarded by the Irish political class as one of the highlights of the Taoiseach’s year.
The envy with which the whole St Patrick’s Day boondoggle is viewed by other countries, competitors for influence and favour with the Americans, only heightens the Gaelic delight. Nor does British jealousy diminish it. Remember, politics in all its forms is a fundamentally human endeavour.
Every year, when March rolls around, the same dreary arguments about sending Ministers all over the world are rehearsed; every year politicians of all parties come to the same conclusion – St Patrick’s Day offers an unbuyable opportunity to project Irish soft power and influence.
Nowhere is this truer than it is in Washington, from where I write this. The avenues here are lined with the embassies of all the nations of the earth. And every single one of them would give a generation of their first born for the opportunity and access enjoyed here by the Irish Taoiseach.
So the Taoiseach’s disappointment is understandable, even if he bore up manfully: “It’s not the end of the world,” he said. For the rest of us, however, it is neither here nor there: what matters are the results that he can achieve. Decent progress was reported this week.
On Thursday, as Martin Wall reported, Senate majority whip Dick Durbin, chair of Senate judiciary committee and senator Pat Toomey, ranking member of the Senate banking committee, introduced bipartisan legislation which could lead to visas for 5,000 more Irish people every year.
As ever, there were pledges galore to defend the Belfast Agreement and support the cause of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. This is not merely a matter of supportive words. Time and time again, the United States has intervened in the North, sometimes crucially. From the visa granted to Gerry Adams to help him sell the ceasefires to the IRA's American supporters, to the patient hand-holding of the parties by senator George Mitchell when push came to shove in 1998, while Bill Clinton worked the phones in the White House, to the economic and social programmes the US has funded in the North – US interest in Ireland has yielded concrete benefits for Irish people, North and South, in their daily lives. And that's before you even consider the economic dividends.
If you think all this has nothing to do with green ties and bowls of shamrock in Washington, you need to revisit your understanding of how the worlds of politics and diplomacy work.
In this struggle between two world views, between democracies and autocracies, Ireland is very clearly on one side – with the democracies, with the West, with the European Union, and with (if not in)

The Taoiseach also used this week to clearly position Ireland in the camp of the liberal, democratic, free-trading western states in a struggle that Biden suggests has relevance and impact far beyond the borders of Ukraine. If Martin is trying to edge Ireland away from the understanding that many people have of our traditional neutrality (and I think he is), he is doing this slowly and carefully and he said nothing in Washington to alarm the many people who are extremely nervous about any such move. Even Biden referenced Ireland's neutrality approvingly.
While speaking to the Taoiseach, the president also gave a fascinating insight into his analysis of the moment the world now finds itself in. In a window to a frank conversation between the two most powerful people in the world, Biden also described the view of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Here is what Biden said in full:
“I think we’re at an inflection point in history. I mean this sincerely – it occurs every several generations. I think we’re in a genuine struggle between autocracies and democracies, and whether or not democracies can be sustained. I’m going to be speaking with President Xi tomorrow and he’ll remind me that I told him – he remembers every damn thing I’ve said. But all kidding aside, we’ve talked about the idea, he does not believe that democracies can be sustained in the 21st century. Because things move so rapidly, technology is changing so much, democracies don’t have time to arrive at consensus. That’s why autocracies will succeed, [Xi believes].”
In this struggle between two world views, between democracies and autocracies, Ireland is very clearly on one side – with the democracies, with the West, with the European Union, and with (if not in) Nato. For all the too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral in Washington this week, that was the important message that Martin brought to Washington: we know you're on our side – and we're on your side.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN is set to travel to Brussels tomorrow for an EU Council meeting on the war in Ukraine after he was stuck in Washington DC due to Covid-19.
Martin is set to return to Ireland from Washington this evening, following several days in isolation in the US after he tested positive for the virus ahead of his meeting with US President Joe Biden.
A spokesperson for the Taoiseach said that Martin would be attending the summit in Brussels after he received two successive negative tests before leaving Washington.
“The Taoiseach will attend an important meeting of the European Council in Brussels tomorrow which will discuss Russian military aggression against Ukraine, security and defence, energy, economic issues, COVID-19 and external relations,” the spokesperson said.
“He has now received two successive negative COVID tests ahead of his departure from the US, and he will fly home from Washington DC this evening.”
The Journalunderstands that Martin is feeling well and is symptom-free and that he will wear a mask while in Brussels, as per public health advice.
It’s understood that there were consultations with Aer Lingus, Irish public health advisors, Brussels and the EU, which all advise that people wait seven days following a positive test before travelling.
The Taoiseach first tested positive for the virus on Wednesday 16 March.

EU Council
The two-day EU Council summit is set to be attended by US President Joe Biden, with leaders of the 27 EU countries considering establishing a “trust fund” for Ukraine following the Russian invasion.
Documents seen by the AFP news agency detail plans to help Ukraine rebuild following the war but there is currently no indication of how big this fund could be.
“Bearing in mind the destruction and enormous losses brought upon Ukraine by Russia’s military aggression, the European Union is committed to provide support to the Ukrainian Government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine,” the draft conclusions for the meeting said.
“To that end, the European Council agrees to set up a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund and calls for preparations to start without delay.”
The trust fund was first suggested by EU Council President Charles Michel in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday.
Michel said it would “help provide basic services and meet citizens’ immediate needs” and would “give liquidity for continued support to authorities and in the longer term serve as backbone for reconstruction”.
The EU has already agreed €1.2 billion in emergency funding to help the Ukrainian authorities.

JUSTICE MINISTER HELEN McEntee has tested positive for Covid-19.
A spokesperson for the Justice Minister confirmed her positive diagnosis this morning.
“The Minister is working from home after a positive Covid test in recent days,” said the spokesperson.
It comes as Health Minister Stephen Donnelly is currently isolating at home due to flu-like symptoms.
Donnelly confirmed that he had tested negative for Covid but that he would continue to isolate for the next 48 hours in line with public health advice.

Unfortunately, I have flu-like symptoms. Have tested negative for Covid but am isolating at home in line with public health advice - and will continue to do so for 48 hours after my symptoms have resolved.
Last week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin tested positive for Covid-19 while visiting Washington DC for the traditional St Patrick’s Day events with US President Joe Biden.
The annual shamrock ceremony was carried out remotely, with Martin appearing on a TV screen beside Biden.
A Government spokesperson confirmed yesterday that Martin is asymptomatic. He chaired a meeting of the Cabinet remotely from Washington yesterday.
Current plans around whether or not Martin will leave Washington to travel to an EU Council meeting in Brussels are still up in the air, with the spokesperson saying that he will make a decision this afternoon.
Due to EU Council rules, if the Taoiseach cannot attend no other member of Government can go in his place and another head of state will have to represent Ireland’s interests at the summit.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has this morning said that Dr Tony Holohan’s secondment to Trinity College should be paused to allow for greater transparency.
It emerged earlier this week that Dr Holohan wasstepping downas the country’s Chief Medical Officer to take up the role as a Professor of Public Health Strategy and Leadership at TCD in July.
However, speaking to RTÉ in Helsinki this morning, Martin said that process should be paused.
“There has to be transparency. There has to be good process and procedure. I don’t see this just as a human resource issue or a personnel issue in its own right, which I can understand.
“In my view, you know, it should be paused. There should be a reassessment as to how the objectives that are behind this can be realised in a better and more transparent way.”
Itemergedthis week that the post Dr Holohan was to take up is an “open-ended secondment” paid for by the Department of Health under the same terms as Dr Holohan’s existing contract.
Recent reports show the CMO’s salary is around €187,000 per year.

Questions have been raised about how the position was filled and the communications surrounding Holohan’s appointment.
Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance Public Expenditure and Reform, John McGuinness, told RTE’s Morning Ireland that the committee has “serious concerns about how the department reached the decision in relation to all of this and also the fact that the minister was not informed”.
Speaking to reporters this morning, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said it was “the right decision” that Holohan’s secondment be paused.
Varadkar said that he had “assumed” that Holohan had applied for the role.
“I was delighted to hear that Tony was getting the professorship at Trinity, I think he’s an excellent person, and will be very capable of doing that job. But I suppose when I heard about it I kind of assumed the job came up and he applied for it and got it. It appears that it’s actually even more complicated than that,” Varadkar said.
“So we think it’s appropriate, because it does involve taxpayers money, that the appointment should be paused for a short period while we can find out exactly how it came about, and to reassure ourselves that procedures were correctly followed. I’m sure they were but we want to be sure of that.”
The Department of Health has been contacted for comment.

Jennifer Bray,"Accommodation for Ukrainian refugees will be ‘stretched’, says Taoiseach",Micheál Martin signals ‘difficult’ weeks ahead as Ireland seeks to fulfil EU obligations,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/accommodation-for-ukrainian-refugees-will-be-stretched-says-taoiseach-1.4847922?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-04-08T09:08:04+00:00,"The expulsion of two Irish diplomats from the embassy in Moscow has been described as “completely unjustified” by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.
The Irish ambassador to Russia, Brian McElduff, was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in Moscow on Thursday afternoon and told two diplomats had been asked to leave.
""It is completely unjustified. The two people concerned are diplomats, engaged in nothing other than diplomatic activities. We did expel four senior members of the Russian team for behaviour not compatible with diplomatic activities and contrary to diplomatic norms,"" said Mr Martin, who is in Helsinki in Finland meeting president Sauli Niinistö and Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin.
In a statement, the Russian embassy in Dublin said Moscow would respond “proportionally to any hostile steps” from the Government, which it said had been following a “destructive line towards Russia”.
The expulsion of the two Irish diplomats were “appropriate reciprocal measures” to the “unfriendly and groundless” decision by Ireland to expel four Russian diplomats from the embassy on Orwell Road last week, it said.
The Russian ministry of foreign affairs called on Irish authorities “to immediately remove any obstacles to the work of the Embassy of Russia in Dublin and ensure normal conditions for the functioning of the Russian diplomatic mission”, the statement said.
Earlier this week, it was reported that the Russian embassy had appealed to the Government for help as it faced a fuel shortage, due to Irish oil companies refusing to deliver supplies to the Dublin property.
In Helsinki, Mr Martin said that on the issue of neutrality, Ireland must play to its strengths.
“Nothing in Ireland’s position on military neutrality in any way impedes the EU response. We are not a strong military country, so we want to play to our strengths where we can be most effective in terms of our contribution. We will reflect on these issues later. For now we want to maintain our strong unity of purpose.”
Speaking after his meeting with Ms Marin, Mr Martin said the two discussed the implications for security arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
“While Ireland is a militarily neutral country we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of these war crimes and opposition.”
Ms Marin said the Russian invasion had fundamentally changed the security situation in Finland. Russia and Finland are separated by a 1,340km-long border.
She said more must be done to weaken Russia’s ability to finance war.
“We want to help in any way we can. We are in this situation with Ukraine and we all have to help Ukraine to win the war. And I think it is not a question of if they win the war, it is when they will win. In our hearts Ukrainians have already won the war,” Ms Marin said.
Asked if Finland would join Nato, she said there would be discussions in the coming weeks in the Finnish parliament.
Earlier, speaking after his meeting with Mr Niinistö, Mr Martin said they had a ""very broad discussion in terms of the international situation, particularly the war on Ukraine, the degree to which the multilateral order has been turned upside down, the sheer barbaric nature of the attack on Ukrainian civilians, and the implications for the security architecture of Europe well into the future and the capacity of open economies like Ireland and Finland that are very alike"".
Mr Martin later travelled to Tallinn to meet the prime minister of Estonia Kaja Kallas.
In a press conference in Estonia, Mr Martin said the EU wants to phase out the dependence on Russian gas and oil.
He also said that his visit to Finland and Estonia showed him that the “world is fundamentally different because of Russia’s unjustifiable war on Ukraine”.
“We support stronger sanctions again, and will push for stronger sanctions,” Mr Martin said.
“The Irish people are horrified with the barbarity of this war on the civilians of Ukraine.”
Ms Kallas said the initial sanctions imposed by the EU were robust and quick but have not been enough, adding, “We must do more.”
“We will keep isolating Russia in every possible way as its brutal war against Ukraine continues.”
Mr Martin and Ms Kallas also discussed energy supplies and security and defence in their meeting on Friday afternoon.

He said that the report would be published. Dr Holohan was appointed as Professor of Public Health Strategy at TCD on March 25th and announced on the same day he was stepping down as chief medical officer. However, over the weekend, Dr...",https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/taoiseach-to-discuss-watt-report-on-holohan-secondment-with-cabinet-1.4850844?localLinksEnabled=false,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-04-12T12:30:50+00:00,"The report by secretary general of the Department of Health Robert Watt into the appointment of Dr Tony Holohan to Trinity College is understood to contradict the Taoiseach’s view that the appointment was not a “personnel issue” that did not require political approval.
Significant unease remains around Government about the differences between the Taoiseach, some ministers and Mr Watt on the issue, with an Oireachtas committee expected to hold hearings on the issue after Easter.
Speaking on Sunday, Taoiseach Micheal Martin said emphatically that the proposed secondment of Chief Medical Officer Dr Holohan to Trinity to head up a new research programme was not a personnel matter.
“People might have seen this as a personnel issue in the first instance,” Mr Martin said, “but it’s clear to me now that it’s broader than that in terms of what was envisaged around the research proposals involving universities and so forth”.
“Anything that involves the spending of public money or any substantive multi-annual programme of research is a policy issue that does require approval by government,” he said, adding that there was a need for “transparency from the outset”.
However, the report on the issue submitted by Mr Watt to the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly yesterday is understood to argue that the proposed Honohan secondment was a staffing and personnel issue that did not require ministerial or political approval - thus putting Mr Watt’s view directly at odds with the view of the Taoiseach.
A spokesman for Mr Donnelly declined to say if the Minister shared the view of the Taoiseach or of his secretary general. He said that Mr Donnelly would comment when the report was published.
Sources with knowledge of the affair say that the research programme to be headed up by Dr Holohan would have cost some €2 million a year, or €20 million over 10 years.
It’s also understood that Mr Watt’s report says that the secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach Martin Fraser was briefed on the proposed move.
The controversy is set to continue as the chair of the Oireachtas Finance Committee John McGuinness said that the committee would asked the senior civil servants involved, and potentially the ministers, to attend when the Dail returns after Easter.
Asked yesterday morning if he had read Mr Watt’s report, Mr Martin said he had a “quick look” at the report on Monday evening but would have a deeper look at it on Tuesday and then discuss it with his Cabinet colleagues. He said that the report would be published.
Asked if it was true that the establishment of the Chair of Public Health Strategy would have cost €2 million per annum over a 10 year period, he did not directly address the question but said the funding for the position would eventually have come through the Health Research Bureau.
“People know the respect that I have for Dr Holohan, which goes back over a long number of years. I find the entire situation that we are in regrettable. I believe there should have been more transparency about this from the outset.
“It is clear that the funding was to come from the Department of Health through to the Health Research Board, out of which the salary (of €187,000 per annum) would have been paid.”
He also confirmed that Dr Holohan will chair the recently established successor group to Nphet until his retirement in July.
He added that people had developed concepts around research projects which in themselves were not necessarily wrong.
“I think what should happen in terms of any major research proposal is that it should be considered by the Government as a whole,” he said.

Following the meeting, the Taoiseach said: ""Prime Minister Shmyhal gave me a first-hand account of events on the ground in Ukraine, of the appalling massacres in Bucha in particular, and the continuing attacks on civilians and on towns.
""Clearly the strategy of the Putin regime is not just killing people in an immoral and unjust war in Ukraine, but of causing huge international instability around energy and food.
""The Prime Minister outlined some clear objectives, around financial support to enable the Ukrainian Government to continue to feed its people, and to keep the economy going despite the enormous destruction caused by the war.
""He reiterated the need for support for Ukraine’s European application to join the European Union, and I assured him ofIreland’s strong proactive support.
""We also discussed a sixth round of sanctions to create further pressure on Putin’s regime to ensure the sanctions create a deterrent against the continuation of this war.""
During the meeting, the Ukrainian Prime Minister also spoke of the need for international assistance and expertise to deal with clearing unexploded munitions and cluster bombs, as well as logistic support on excavating residential blocks destroyed by Russian attacks.
He reiterated the determination of the Ukrainian Government to protect their people and resist the ongoing aggression by Russian forces in the Eastern region.
The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister's meeting comes two weeks after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyaddressed the Irish government. In his address, Zelenskyy said: ""although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.""
There are now 24,438 Ukrainians in Ireland, RTE reported on Wednesday, with 1,271 being accommodated in emergency beds. The Cabinet heard on Wednesday evening that based on predictions, there will be a shortage of accommodation for Ukrainians arriving in Ireland
by the end of the month.

A MONTHLY PAYMENT of €400 for people who take Ukrainian refugees into their home is being considered by the Government.
The €400 payment is being considered to help with the cost of housing Ukrainian refugees and that the Government expects it to be used to cover the cost of increased bills.
The payment will not be automatically applied and households who take in refugees will have to apply to receive the payment.
It is understood that the final payment amount has not yet been decided.
Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that Ireland was examining new options for housing refugees due to some facilities being exhausted.
Martin said that a cap on the number of refugees who could enter the country was not being considered and that there was a duty to look after those who are arriving into Ireland.
“We’re not considering that [cap on refugees] at all, we’re looking at looking after people as they come into the country,” said Martin.
“It means new options and different options given that we’ve exhausted a lot of facilities already but we’re consistently looking at expanding our capacities and looking at it, not just in the short-term but in the medium-term.”
Justice Minister Helen McEntee said yesterday that “every option” is being explored to house Ukrainian refugees and that the Government will encourage people to offer space in their homes rather than forcing anyone.

“We want to encourage people to come forwards, not to force anybody to have to give up their property or accommodation,” McEntee said.
She also backed the proposal for financial aid for households that take in Ukrainian refugees.
“There are people who are looking for it, there are others who aren’t, but I think obviously if we get to a situation where we want to encourage more people to offer up accommodation, that might be an option,” McEntee told reporters yesterday.
“We’re very aware that there’s an increase in costs in electricity and fuel, even in food prices.
“So I think what we’d have to establish is how we would cover those costs. I don’t think anybody’s looking to make money out of this.”
Government sources have confirmed that “a lot of detail” about the scheme has yet to be worked out and the proposal is unlikely to go to Cabinet on Tuesday, but rather in another week or two.
Once signed off on, sources state it would take a while to operationalise.
Approximately 25,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived into Ireland since the war broke out in late February, with approximately 16,000 of them seeking accommodation.
Numbers of refugees arriving into the country have stalled in recent days, however the Government does expect figures to rise in the weeks ahead.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN said voters want politicians to return to power sharing after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections.
Speaking at a parliamentary committee this morning, the Taoiseach urged political parties to work “collectively” after the election.
Voters will go to the polls in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections on 5 May.
There has been speculation that Sinn Féin could emerge as the largest political party in the Assembly.
There are also concerns that the DUP may refuse to return to power sharing amid ongoing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol and the response of the UK Government to post-Brexit arrangements for the region.
Micheál Martin was addressing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, where he appeared to discuss the Government’s shared island project to boost cross-border ties on the island.
“Next week, the people of Northern Ireland will vote to provide a new democratic mandate for the devolved power-sharing institutions at Stormont,” he said.
“This is a moment for political leaders to live up to the commitments of the Good Friday Agreement, which is overwhelmingly supported by people across this island.”
Martin also took the opportunity to express concern over the impact Brexit and the protocol have had on the peace process in Northern Ireland.

The post-Brexit settlement for Northern Ireland has dominated politics in the region in recent years, amid unionist and loyalist outcry at the creation of new checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea from Britain.
The Fianna Fáil leader, for whom the shared island initiative is something of a personal passion, called for political leadership to move beyond the ongoing tensions over Brexit.
“Political leadership – by all with a role and responsibility – is also fundamental in getting beyond the issues around Brexit and the protocol that have hindered the peace process over the last six years,” he said.
“We need to return the focus to working collectively to support progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland and across this island, and to realising the opportunities in our societal, economic, cultural and political relationships through the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.
“These are the Government’s objectives and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.”
The Government has committed a total of €3.5 billion for all-island, cross-border investment over the coming decade.
Areas for cooperation include healthcare, education and tourism, as well as transport and biodiversity.
Martin said the aim is to deepen north-south and east-west relationships.
He spoke of “good engagement” with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson as well as politicians in Northern Ireland on the issue.
“The Government wants to see a deepening of beneficial co-operation and societal connections on the island, in all areas,” he told the committee.

Ireland’s taoiseach has said it is unacceptable for one party inNorthern Irelandto block others from taking power, as he visited Belfast to try to break the deadlock over the Brexit protocol and power-sharing at Stormont.
After meetings with party leaders,Micheál Martinsaid the Northern Ireland assembly and executive should be formed while negotiations continued between the UK government and the EU over the protocol. “Our view is there should be parallel discussions,” he said as he urged the DUP to abandon its decision not to return to power-sharing until “decisive action” was taken over reforms to Northern Ireland’s Brexit arrangements.Earlier he said it was “unheard of in a democratic world” that a parliament could not convene after an election. “We can’t have a situation where one political party determines that the other political parties can’t convene in a parliament,” he said.
He said he understood there were “legitimate issues” to be discussed with the DUP but that the only answer to the problem was collaboration, not confrontation.
He accused Boris Johnson of “moving the goalposts” over the protocol and going “too far in a unilateral way” in the UK’s approach to Northern Ireland after the foreign secretary, Liz Truss,announced plansto introduce domestic laws to override the protocol if the EU did not meet the government’s demands.
His visit came as the first minister elect, Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, flew to Scotland for talks with Nicola Sturgeon.
They discussed the protocol and the deepening cost of living crisis.
The Scottish first minister said unilateral action to disapply part of the protocol would have “incredibly damaging effects”, and “pitching us into a trade dispute with the EU could be what tips us over [into recession]”.
O’Neill, who requested the meeting in Edinburgh, said she updated Sturgeon on the benefits of the special Brexit arrangements allowing NorthernIreland, uniquely in the UK, to continue free trade access to the EU and how this was “yielding benefits for business and our local economy”.
Back in Belfast, Martin said UK claims that the EU was being intransigent and inflexible were exaggerated. “I spoke to Boris Johnson and I have to nail this, this idea that somehow theEuropean Unionis being inflexible on this is just not the truth, it doesn’t stack up.
“What has happened now is a certain unilateralism on behalf of the British government saying ‘our way or no way’ and you don’t negotiate with the European Union on that basis, particularly when you have signed off on the agreement that you now don’t like.”
His comments came as a US delegation of Republican and Democratic congressional representativeslanded in Europe for a week of talkswith Brussels, London and Dublin leaders to try to calm tensions over Northern Ireland.
They will meet Truss on Saturday morning. Richard Neal, the chair of the US ways and means committee, said he would be reminding everyone that the 1998 peace agreement was hard won and not just a “cavalier achievement” that could be used for domestic political ends.
His trip coincided with abroadside by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who said unilateral action on the protocol could damage the UK’s chances of a trade deal.
The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, told the BBC in response that if “Pelosi wants to see the agreement protected then she needs to recognise that it is the protocol that is harming and undermining the agreement and that is why we need to deal with it”. He said the protocol had “changed some of the key principles” of the accord and “made it impossible to have power-sharing on the basis of consensus”.",Positive

Can we take it then that Mr Martin would favour tearing up the 2016 “Fresh Start” agreement which allows parties to go into opposition in the Assembly?
Or does he believe that it is tenable to insist that the DUP – and only the DUP – must be forced to enter government?
More fundamentally, however, a political party can do whatever it wishes with its electoral mandate, and this includes deciding whether or not to go into government.
If voters don’t like the decisions parties make then they’re free to vote for someone else at the next election. But the simple fact that a party has received a substantial electoral mandate does not mean there is an obligation on them to enter government.
In 2016, the then-taoiseach Enda Kenny asked Fianna Fáil to enter government with Fine Gael as equal partners, an offer which Mr Martin quickly refused. Does he now believe that this was an “undemocratic” decision on his own part? Does a different standard apply to Fianna Fáil than to the DUP?
Sinn Féin, which refuses to take its seats in the House of Commons, is now excoriating the DUP for its possible refusal to take its seats in the Executive. You have to wonder how they can maintain this position with a straight face, but they have now been given some helpful covering fire by Mr Martin.
The only “undemocratic” features of the Northern Ireland institutions are its bizarre system of compulsory government which strangles proper political accountability, and the regular need for ministers in Dublin, London and further afield to constantly mediate between a group of grown adults who are members of the same government, as parents might coddle and soothe squabbling children.
It’s high time that the political parties and institutions in Northern Ireland were given a dose of cold hard political reality, and either sorted out their own problems or face being closed down for good. – Yours, etc,

The next six weeks will be used to try and get a power sharing agreement in place, with the row over the protocol viewed in Government Buildings as the main obstacle to this happening.
Speaking at the weekend, Taoiseach Micheál Martin urged the parties in the North to “deliver on their mandate” and enter a new executive, saying this was “vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland”.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the election had obviously been a good one for Sinn Féin but the big winners were undoubtedly the Alliance Party.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party will not enter an executive unless the British government takes action to address unionist concerns about the protocol.
Talks on the protocol take place between the UK government and EU directly. Mr Coveney said he had been in touch with both lead negotiators, British foreign secretary Liz Truss and EU commissioner Maroš Šefcovic, and the aim of these discussions had been “to work towards a basis for agreement”.
He said he hoped ""that by doing that we can assist the parties in coming together because the last thing we need now in Northern Ireland is a collapse of the institutions and all the tension and polarisation that would flow from that"".
He told RTÉ intensive work was needed in the coming weeks to ""allow an executive to be re-established on the basis of acceptance that both sides have worked towards maximum flexibility on the protocol"". He insisted, ""It doesn't need to take months and months.""
Mr Coveney said the EU had shown flexibility with proposals that would reduce checks on goods coming into the North from Britain and that London needed to compromise too.
On Friday, in an initial response to her party’s success in the Assembly elections, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald suggested a Border poll on a united Ireland “would be possible within a five-year time frame” and preparation needed to “start now”.
Mr Coveney said he did not see the result as bringing a Border poll any closer, saying “The balance between the nationalist vote and the unionist vote hasn’t changed hugely.”
Ms McDonald later said the election result had brought about “change” not just in Sinn Féin’s success in becoming the largest party in the Assembly but also that of the Alliance Party.
She said, “The appetite to work together in partnership and to plan for our future is just a matter of plain common sense.”
Ms McDonald called on the Government to “lead from the front” and said a citizens’ assembly was needed to discuss a potential united Ireland.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said the number of new staff recruited by the HSE this year could be just over half of what is funded.
Speaking in the Dáil today, Martin said that the “current market situation” dictates that 5,500 new staff could be hired despite funding being in place for 10,000.
Martin was facing questions from Labour leader Alan Kelly TD following an article in theSunday Business Post which containeddetails of a secret recording of Department of Health officials in which the officials spoke about “fake targets”.
The leaked recording revealed that officials in the meeting said that a stated recruitment target of 10,000 was “not going to happen” and that “fake targets” were driven by politicians.
It was also reported that officials made comments about “dysfunction” and distrust in the health sector.
“Officials in the Department of Health are saying that the idea we will recruit 10,000 people is – and I apologise in advance for the language used by one of the officials – “batshit”,” Kelly told the Dáil today.
In response, Martin noted that the article was based on a “secretly recorded transcript” and that “public servants and people more generally are entitled to brainstorm or have meetings without being secretly recorded”.
Martin denied that the target figure of 10,000 staff recruited was driven by politicians.

“The HSE came forward last year, not politicians, with a figure of 16,000.  It was presented to a health committee meeting that the HSE said it would recruit 16,000 in 2021,” he said.
He added: “Discussions are now under way between the Department of Health and the HSE in respect of utilising the funding that will not be used for the 10,000 recruitment figure on waiting list initiatives and other initiatives within the health service.”
Kelly had described the leaks as “extraordinary” and said it suggested to him that  “we are further away than we have ever been from the single-tier public health service we desire”.
“To be frank, the commentary in the meeting that was the subject of the leak was quite derogatory from a relationship point of view as regards how we are ever going to achieve the service we want,” he said.
In response to Kelly’s categorisation of the meeting, An Taoiseach said that he was “obviously not there and do not understand the context or tone” of the transcript.
He added, however, that “not all the material in it was accurate”.
Speaking yesterday, HSE CEO Paul Reid confirmed that there is funding in place for 10,000 people but this may not be met.
“When we look at the recruitment process for this year coming, we have funding for 10,000 people. We will be striving to achieve as close as possible to that. The reality, as we know what the market is, there’s a big global demand,” Reid said yesterday.
Reid also said report in the Sunday Business Post failed to reflect “joint engagement” between the HSE and the Department of Health.

THERE WERE HEATED scenes in the Dáil today when Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty rounded on the Taoiseach over the report into the champagne gathering that took place in the Department of Foreign Affairs last year.
The review into the gathering, conducted by Foreign Affairs Secretary General Joe Hackett, said it has “caused offence” and that then secretary general Niall Burgess was “largely responsible for facilitating the breach of social distance guidance that occurred”.
It subsequently ordered Burgess to make a €2,000 donation to a Covid-19 charity, while three other officials are to also make a €1,000 donation to a charity providing assistance to people affected by the virus.
Doherty called on the Taoiseach to carry out an independent review into the matter, something Micheál Martin said he would not be doing.
Doherty also called for Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney to come before the Dáil to answer questions on the matter.
Martin said he is “satisfied with the investigation” that took place, stating that what took place within the department that evening was “wrong and shouldn’t have happened”.
However, he said he was taken aback by Doherty’s “tone and attitude on this one” accusing Doherty and his party members of inviting a crowd of 2,000 onto the streets for the funeral of Bobby Storey in 2020.

The Taoiseach said everyone else on the island was limited to having 30 people at a funeral.
The funeral of senior IRA figure Bobby Storey drew hundreds of people on to the streets. A number of Sinn Féín members attended the funeral at a time.
Sinn Fein party president Mary Lou McDonald, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and former party president Gerry Adams, as well as Doherty, were among high-profile party members who were in attendance at the service and later a commemoration event at Milltown cemetery.
In July 2020, Doherty defended attending the funeral after images showed a large crowd lining the streets.
He said at the time that he believed the funeral “of a friend of ours who has passed away” was being politicised.
Martin told Doherty in the Dáil today that to the best of his knowledge neither “you or your organisation has ever admitted that you were wrong”.
“Yet you lecture everybody else… there is one law for Sinn Féin, and one law for everybody else,” he said.
A number of other Government TDs and senators have taken to social media to make similar comparisons today.
Doherty said it is disgraceful that the Taoiseach was comparing a “champagne party with a funeral”, stating that there is a grieving family to think about.
“I am telling the home truths, I don’t like doing it,” added Martin.
He said those civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs are “public servants who are given a long service to the State, they have admitted they were wrong and they’ve apologised for one minute in the breach of social distancing guidance,” he said.

He was responding to Independent TD Joan Collins in the Dáil on Tuesday, who raised a recent Labour Court ruling that two migrant women were unfairly dismissed by The Ivy – operated by Troia UK Restaurants Ltd – in Dublin on foot of trade union activities.
Julia Marciniak and Lenka Laiermanova were fired from the restaurant in March 2019. They had worked at the high-profile eatery on Dublin's Dawson Street since soon after it opened in summer 2018.
Initially hired on hourly rates of €10.55 and €12 plus 80 per cent of tips (with the other 20 per cent going to back-of-house staff), that arrangement turned sour when tips and service charges were withheld and instead used to part-pay those contracted hourly rates, making up the difference between minimum wage and their stated pay.
When Ms Marciniak and Ms Laiermanova raised this and other issues with management and got nowhere, they went to Ms Collins and joined Unite.
Ms Collins said it was “quite rare” for an unfair dismissal case of trade union activity to be won in the Labour Court, and that the case had “a wider significance”.
“That significance is that while the Unfair Dismissals Act only kicks in after a year with a specific employer, there are exceptions [to this], one of which is trade union activity,” she said.
“However, that one-year rule does give some employers and managers licence to dismiss workers on a whim.”
The Dublin South-Central TD said she wanted to congratulate the two women and that the general issue of service charges had to be dealt with.
“That [service charge] has to go in my opinion, and The Ivy still has a 12.5 per cent service charge on all tables,” she said.
“It is used to pay wages and supplement business income. An owner-manager of a bar-restaurant, Conor O’Meara, says service charges should be abolished and I concur.”
Mr Martin said many people were under the impression that when they pay a service charge, it went to workers, and that was “not the case in many instances”.
“I think we need absolute transparency and ideally actually, I think the consumer should be handing [tips] directly to the employee or group of employees, however those mechanisms can be facilitated, as an additional sort of contribution.”
He said he was “minded” to abolish service charges, adding: “I think in any event there should be full and absolute transparency governing them.”

But who will come?
First-time buyers desperate to escape crippling rent or property investors keen to cash in on their misery?
In the Dáil, the hamster wheel of housing keeps on spinning. Round and round it goes with the same arguments from the Opposition and the same answers from the Government.
The frustration on both sides is obvious.
The Taoiseach stands by his single-word remedy: supply. The only way to solve the housing crisis – and Micheál Martin has no difficulty agreeing with his critics that we are in the middle of a crisis – is by building loads more houses as quickly as possible. Thirty-three thousand “starts” needed every year for the foreseeable.
But what happens in the meantime?
The ugly gap between identifying the problem and fixing it formed Wednesday’s Dáil battleground. The Sinn Féin leader and the Social Democrats co-leader zoomed in on the well-documented predicament of renters stranded in a cutthroat zone with no means of buying their way out.
Mary Lou McDonald and Catherine Murphy began with a clear advantage. They know younger people (along with family and friends who care about them) are in deep despair over housing. This is the burning issue of their time and they want their politicians to help.
So both women pleaded with the Taoiseach to take urgent short-term action to curb spiralling rent and house prices. In response, Micheál almost sounded apologetic when referring them for the umpteenth time to his Government’s cure for the current sickness in the market – it’s called supply.
As for those “desperately seeking to put a roof over their heads” (as McDonald said) or “desperately trying to buy their own houses” (Murphy), what can be done for them now?
For they are out there in their fuming droves. Waiting and listening.
If ever there was an occasion for Mary Lou and her scriptwriter to plunder their extensive and extensively relied upon soundbite locker, it was now. Mary Lou rose to the challenge, producing a bravura performance of Instagrammable indignation.
Cuckoo funds using sweetheart tax deals to massively outbid buyers looking for family homes before renting those homes back to them at extortionate rates. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael making homeownership a pipe dream for an entire generation. A staggering increase in rip-off rents. A social disaster.
And where is all this happening, Taoiseach? On your watch.
Cut rents by means of a tax credit, demanded an impassioned McDonald. Put a ban on runaway rent increases, “and for God’s sake do these things for the renters of this country!”
Catherine Murphy left the punchy video-clip flourishes to her Sinn Féin counterpart and she spoke quietly, more in sorrow than anger
Slowly, patiently, Micheál Martin explained about the need to increase supply above all else. He flourished the Daft report the Sinn Féin leader cited when quoting the alarming figures for rent rises – with average rents in parts of Dublin over the €2,000 threshold now.
He read a line from the report’s key conclusions. “‘As ever, the solution remains in the construction of large numbers of market and cost-rental housing to cater for tenants of all incomes.’ That is THEIR conclusion.”
“Twang!” He flicked his fingers off the pages.
The Government’s Housing for All strategy is the right one, he said. “We now need to get on with it and allow the houses to be built.”
Yet what happens in the meantime to renters languishing in the cutthroat zone? What about that ugly gap?
Catherine Murphy left the punchy video-clip flourishes to her Sinn Féin counterpart and she spoke quietly, more in sorrow than anger. She was equally if not more effective, her words capturing the sense of frustration and quiet desperation felt by so many caught up in this crisis.
What did the Taoiseach have to say to people trying to buy a house? “Tell them to stop complaining or to shop around?”
While he said bulk-buying of private homes by investment vehicles has been blocked, she told a different story. “Ordinary workers can shop around for an eternity but increasingly they feel they are chasing shadows. ”
So, while accepting “rents are too high for people”, Micheál repeated that only building more houses will end this mess. And while the Government is powering ahead with the biggest building programme in the history of the State, there is also a place for private sector investors in bringing about the solution.
An exasperated Murphy, who represents the commuter-belt constituency of Kildare North, did not disagree. ""It's a big part of the solution, but it has to have constraints put on it.""
She put her hands out and asked the Taoiseach: “Do you ever question that you could be getting this wrong? Like, Fianna Fáil have got it wrong before. ”
No surprise in a reply going back to supplies. Housing supply is the key. “It’s happening. Thirty-one thousand starts . . .”
“I know we need supply. But affordable supply,” said the Soc Dem co-leader. Worried TDs on the Coalition side of the House know this too because they aren’t blind to the immediate problem either.
In the ugly gap on the way to Micheál’s field of dreams, is there nothing his Government can do to help?

Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also travelled to the summit andspoke to Bloomberg yesterday.
An Taoiseach spoke to Bloomberg about the Northern Ireland Protocol, the war in Ukraine and the energy and inflation crises affecting Europe.
Speaking about the latter, he said it could present long-term opportunities for Ireland.
“For the next decade, the big investment in Ireland will be in offshore wind,” he said.
Martin said the EU’s only path is towards renewables and that Ireland will have to “double down on that” amid the current pressure on fossil fuel prices.

“I think this is a watershed in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables,” he said.
Martin added that the inflation crisis will “get worse towards the end of the year” but that this was part Vladimir Putin’s war aims and that democracies must “hold the line”.

Speaking about the current impasse over the Northern Ireland Protocol, Martin questioned whether there was “a will” within the UK government to resolve it.
The UK government has threatened to unilaterally change some elements of the Protocol agreed between the UK and EU, with Martin saying this was “not how democracies and countries of like mind normally behave”.
Martin added that he believes the UK government hasn’t given negotiations “a chance” and he suggested there may be “different agendas at play”.
“We’re concerned as to whether there are different agendas at play, or whether the UK government really wants to settle this because I don’t see the landing zone for the UK government, or they’re not clear what would resolve this.”

Barry O'Halloran,Revenue from big power companies’ wind farms is multiplying as electricity prices soar,Taoiseach Micheál Martin pledges to consider tax on energy company profits in next month’s budget,https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2022/08/05/revenue-from-big-power-companies-wind-farms-multiply-as-electricity-prices-soar/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-08-04T23:12:00+00:00,"Revenue from big power companies’ wind farms are multiplying as electricity prices soar, official estimates show.
Leading Irish energy players including ESB, Energia and SSE Airtricity all own wind farms that supply electricity to the wholesale market.
The State’s Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) forecasts that wind farms could earn an average of €330.23 a mega watt hour (MW/h) for electricity they sell to the wholesale market over the 12 months from next October.
This is six times the €53.66 MW/h that the regulator predicted the industry would earn over the same period two years ago, before energy prices began rising rapidly in 2021.
News of the surge in wind power earnings comes as families and businesses struggle with high bills that are running at up to €2,600 a year for electricity and €2,200 for natural gas.
The average Irish family uses about 4 MW/h of electricity in a year. As wind farms only operate about a third of the time, their wholesale revenues from each household in the Republic would approach €440 over a year, or €36.67 a month.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin pledged that the Government would consider a windfall tax on energy company profits in next month’s budget. He told reporters yesterday that these businesses were making “significant profits” all around.

[Calls for windfall tax on energy companies intensify as Bord Gáis profits grow 74%Opens in new window]
Up to last year, most wind farms in the Republic earned either €72.69 MW/h or €75.24 MW/h, the minimum prices they are guaranteed under the State’s the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff support scheme.
Asked on Thursday if it could use the boost in wind farm earnings to offset price increases, the ESB said the law obliges it to separate its generating and supply businesses, which includes Electric Ireland.
The State company added that Electric Ireland “continues to offer the best value it can for customers by providing one of the lowest standard electricity rates in the market”.
Energia, which owns about 300MW of wind power, said volatility made price predictions impossible. It added that renewable and gas generators last year “offset significant financial losses” in its retail business.
SSE Airtricity, whose 700MW of wind power make it Ireland’s biggest renewable electricity business, said it did not speculate about prices.
“We’re actively managing current market volatility and seeking to minimise the impact on our customers insofar as possible,” the company said.
The group pointed out that it recently pledged to protect financially vulnerable customers for the rest of the year.
The CRU announced last week that households would get an €89.10 refund from some renewable generators receiving wholesale electricity prices higher than those for which they contracted under a new scheme meant to support their industry.
However, most Irish wind farms benefit from the older REFIT scheme, which does not oblige them to refund cash if the wholesale price tops the amount they are guaranteed under this system.
Wind farms with the capacity to supply 4,000MW of electricity benefit from REFIT, while those that operate under the new Renewable Energy Support Scheme, which includes the refund requirement, only amount to 156MW.
When prices fell short of the sums guaranteed under these schemes, customers make up the difference through a public service obligation charge.
Generators sell electricity at wholesale charges to companies that supply power to homes and businesses. The system is meant to favour power plants that offer the lowest prices.
However, as wind farms get a guaranteed minimum price for their electricity, they simply sell it at whatever the market is paying.

French President Emmanuel Macron, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a press conference this eveningLauren Boland / The JournalLauren Boland / The Journal / The Journal
Lauren Boland reports from the European Council in Brussels
THE EU HAS officially named Ukraine as a candidate for EU membership in a historic decision for the bloc.
The country will now be entitled to begin the complex process of fulfilling the EU’s criteria to become a fully-fledged member.
The EU Council, which is comprised of the heads of state and government of the 27 member countries – including Taoiseach Micheál Martin – has been meeting in Brussels to discuss the potential enlargement of the union after applications from Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.
Speaking at a press conference on the announcement, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission – which recommended that the Council accept Ukraine’s application – described the decision as a “defining moment and a very good day for Europe”.
She said there could be “no better sign of hope for the citizens of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia in these troubled times”.

“Of course, the countries all have to do homework before moving to the next stage of the accession process, but I am convinced that they will move as swiftly as possible and work as hard as possible to implement the necessary reforms,” she added.
“I’m deeply convinced that our decision that we’ve taken today strengthened us all. It strengthens Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia in the face of Russian aggression and it strengthens the European Union because it shows once again to the world that the European Union is united and strong in the face of external events.”

It was expected that Ukraine and Moldova would be approved for formal candidacy, with Georgia offered a ‘European perspective’ while working onprioritiesset out by the European Commission.
The meeting was largely in agreement on the status of those three countries but less clear on how it would proceed in relation to other western Balkan states,The Journalunderstands.
A source said that there were differing opinions among members on how to move forward on bids from current candidates that have been seeking entry for years but which are yet to fulfil all the EU’s criteria in negotiations.
The Council may try to extend a positive signal towards certain countries, particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Earlier today, the Taoiseach said it is taking “too long” for western Balkan countries to be admitted into the European Union.
Ahead of a meeting between the European Council and western Balkan leaders, Martin said including those countries would be an effective counter to “manipulation” in the region.

The Taoiseach and the heads of other member states met the leaders of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Serbia this morning to discuss their efforts to join the EU and the impacts of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Speaking to reporters, the Taoiseach described the Council meeting as “significant” and “historic”.
“We in Ireland know what the European Union means, being a member of the European Union. It’s the 50th anniversary of Ireland’s decision to join the European Union, probably the single most transformative decision and event that happened in modern Irish history,” Martin said.
“I always cannot comprehend how we could ever refuse accession to other member states, because we know that membership itself can be transformative and can spur on reforms, can spur on economic development,” he said.
“I think today the European Union is sending a message of solidarity to the people of Ukraine that you belong to the European family, you belong to the European Union, and the decision will be taken today to facilitate your application and you will have candidate status to join the European Union.”

The Taoiseach said he hoped that “progress” can be made for Western Balkan countries keen to join the EU, particularly North Macedonia and Albania.
“There are issues and our challenges there. My own view is to facilitate a more rapid and accelerated enlargement process in terms of the neighborhood,” Martin said.
“It’s better for the European Union, it’s better for political stability, but above all, it gives those countries in the neighborhood a much better opportunity to develop economically and socially.
“The delays are too long. It’s taking too long for countries like North Macedonia and Albania,” he said.
“Very often Europe complains about manipulation in the neighborhood. The most effective geopolitical counterpoint to that manipulation is to embrace and bring people in.
“As we know ourselves, membership brings its own momentum in terms of economic development and reforms.”
On the western Balkans, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that “the most important question is that we all work together and that the states of the western Balkans will have the opportunity to become members of the EU”.
“They’ve worked so hard and it is our common task to make this something that will happen.”
Near the Council building, Ukraine supporters gathered to call for the EU’s backing, raising chants of “Ukraine is European”.
Lauren Boland / The JournalLauren Boland / The Journal / The Journal
President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola said that naming Ukraine as a candidate will “strengthen” the bloc and that it would be “wrong” not to allow Ukraine to take the next step towards candidacy.
Speaking on arrival at the Council meeting, Metsola said there are “no easy answers or easy decisions – rest assured that there are wrong ones that we must avoid”.
“And it would be a historically wrong decision not to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova today, or give a clear perspective to Georgia,” the EU Parliament President said.

“We should be clear this is not simply some symbolic act; this will strengthen the EU and it will strengthen Ukraine and Moldova.
“It will show our people, as well as theirs, that our values matter more than rhetoric. That hope can mean results. And other countries waiting – those in the Western Balkans – also need to see hope lead to results. It is time.”

Meanwhile, at the European Parliament, MEPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution calling on the Council to give candidate status to Ukraine “without delay”.
The resolution passed by 529 votes to 45 with 14 abstentions. Most Irish MEPs voted in favour, though Independents Clare Daly and Mick Wallace abstained.
It also calls for the Council to give candidate status to Moldova “without delay” and to Georgia “once its government has delivered” onprioritiesoutlined by the European Commission.
Speaking toThe Journalin the Parliament, Fine Gael MEP Deirdre Clune said that “the important message I want to hear from today’s Council meeting is that Europe is going to grant Ukraine candidate status”.

“I think it’s a really important message to send to Ukraine that we want Ukraine to be members of the European Union for all of the values that we stand for – democracy, freedom, human rights and many more,” Clune said.
“It’s also an important message to Russia to say that this is what Ukraine wants, the members of the European Union are standing up to you in this way.
“If this message is delivered today, I think it would be really important and significant for ourselves, for Ukraine, and to Russia.”
Green MEP Ciarán Cuffe said that there was “overwhelming support in the Parliament for Ukrainian membership of the European Union”.

“But it’s got to be remembered that European Union membership is a marathon, not a sprint, so it may take years before this comes to fruition,” he said.
“Some countries, such as Albania and North Macedonia, have been waiting for more than a decade and there’s a sense of frustration there.
“But I think with Putin’s murderous war in Ukraine, there will be a push to accelerate this and hopefully we will see Ukraine as a member of the European Union within the next decade.”

MARC MACSHARRY LOOKS set to rejoin the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, after there were calls to readmit the TD last week.
The parliamentary party heard that Taoiseach Micheál Martin spoke with MacSharry, with the process to readmit the TD set to begin next week, it is understood.
MacSharry resigned the Fianna Fáil whip last yearfollowing the Katherine Zappone controversy that erupted around Foreign Minister Simon Coveney.

The controversy, which stemmed from the appointment of Zappone as a UN Special Envoy, lead to a vote of no-confidence in the Foreign Affairs Minister.
MacSharry had raised concerns about Fianna Fáil’s decision to enforce a whipped vote on the no confidence motion and opted to resign from the parliamentary party as a result.
TDs, Senators and MEPs have been told that chief whip Jack Chambers will table a motion next week to propose that MacSharry be readmitted to the parliamentary party, in line with party rules.
It comes after a proposal was brought last week by TD Barry Cowen to have MacSharry reinstated in the party and was seconded by Senator Diarmuid Wilson.
MacSharry had attended the Fianna Fáil Ard Fhéis in late September and had spoken about returning to the party as soon as possible.

King Charles III, who became King last Thursday after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, will also receive a message of condolence from the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Alex Maskey.
A service of reflection onQueen Elizabeth II's lifein Belfast on Tuesday will be attended by President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Micheál Martin.
The service will be one of several events and engagements during King Charles III's visit toNorthern Ireland.
King Charles III will arrive in Belfast as part of a tour of the UK and will travel to Hillsborough Castle. His wife Camila, the Queen Consort, is expected to accompany him on the visit.

Martin was meeting local parties in Belfast as the deadline to restore Stormont and avoid fresh Assembly elections rapidly approaches.
DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the Irish Government now agreed with him that there is “no quick fix” to the problems created by the protocol, while Sinn Féin vice president Michelle O’Neill said there had to be a way forward within the framework of the post-Brexit agreement.
The DUP is blocking the functioning of the powersharing institutions in Belfast as part of its protest against the protocol which has created barriers on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The UK Government has vowed to secure changes to the protocol, either through a negotiated compromise with the EU or domestic legislation to empower ministers to scrap the arrangements without the approval of Brussels.
Current legislation says that unless Stormont is restored by 28 October, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has to call Assembly elections, which he has said he is prepared to do.
Martin said his talks with Northern Ireland’s political leaders had been useful and open.
He said: “I am very clear in my view that the recent elections should be vindicated, should be realised in the form of the executive and the Assembly being restored.
“We are in very, very challenging times with a very significant cost-of-living crisis.
“It is in that context that the people of Northern Ireland do need an executive and an Assembly to work with everybody else in respect of dealing with these challenges.
“I am also clear that there is clearly a desire with all the major stakeholders for a negotiated resolution of the issues around the protocol.
“That was clear from my meeting with the British Prime Minister Liz Truss and from my engagement with the European Union. Talks have commenced, they should be allowed to continue and get a resolution around issues with the protocol.
“In the interim I think it is vital that the Assembly is restored.”
After his meeting with Martin, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson the Irish Government has recently developed a better understanding of unionist concerns about the protocol.

“I think it is clear that the Irish Government share our view now that we’re not looking here at some kind of a quick fix, that what we need to do is deal with the protocol issues comprehensively, that we need to get to a place where the foundations for the political institutions are restored and strengthened, and that’s where we want to get to,” he said.
Donaldson added there can be no “tinkering around the edges” with the protocol and there is a need to replace it with arrangements that “respect the integrity of the UK internal market”.
“I think the Irish Government recognises and understands our position better now than perhaps had been the case in the past,” he said.

O’Neill called on the DUP to join the rest of the parties to “make politics work”.
She said: “What we need to see is an agreed way forward within the framework of the protocol, find ways to make it work, and get on with that piece of business because that seems to be the blockage, certainly, according to DUP, in terms of forming an executive.
“So there shouldn’t be any more delay and where we need to be today is around an executive table.”
Commenting on the 28 October deadline for calling a new election, O’Neill said: “The DUP need to join the rest of us who want to make politics work, who want to honour the election result from May past and who want to actually help people through what is the most challenging of economic times.”
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long was the first to meet the Taoiseach today.
Asked about a winter election, she said: “If they (the DUP) continue to dig in then it is inevitable.
“But I think the more important question is what purpose does that serve?”
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it is “totally irresponsible” for the DUP to prevent the formation of an executive.
“There’s a massive crisis in people’s homes right now, there’s a crisis, as there always is in the health service, and our economy is in the toilet, and all the way the DUP are sitting out pretending they’re having some influence on the protocol negotiations,” he said.
Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said there was a clear “landing zone” on which the UK and EU could agree a compromise on the protocol.
“We’re now hovering above it and all we have to do is land and that takes courage,” he said.
Martin’s visit to Belfast will conclude with a visit to meet participants in programmes working with schools as catalysts for peace and reconciliation.

Paddy Clancy,Northern Ireland Protocol talks continue amidst chaos in UK,Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said the restoration of Stormont is “vital” while negotiations continue to resolve the impasse over Brexit's Northern Ireland Protocol.,https://www.irishcentral.com/news/thenorth/northern-ireland-protocol-uk-chaos,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-10-19T16:59:15+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin described his Belfast discussions on Monday with Northern Ireland's five main political parties as useful and open.
It was the second major drive within a week by leading political figures to resolve the main issuethat’s keeping the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) out of government in Northern Ireland.
The Martin visit followed similar meetings in Belfast last week whencounselor with the US State Department, Derek Chollet, warned the British government not to take unilateral action on the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of a post-Brexit agreement to ensure a soft trade border in Ireland.
The difference between the two visits was that Chollet’s meetings last week were held against a background of softened tone by the British government on the controversial Protocol, despite the UK being buffeted by financial turmoil and a cost of living crisis.
Martin’s visit took place as British politics descended into deeper chaos this week with Prime Minister Liz Truss fighting desperately to hang on to power after sacking her chancellor and replacing him with another who has ripped her economic strategy to shreds.
Northern Ireland is very much on the back burner at present in British politics, despite the approach ofthe October 28 deadlinewhen a vital decision must be made. If Stormont and its power-sharing institutions, on hold since last May’s election, are not resumed, the British government must decide if there will be another election in the North.
It has said there will be an election if power sharing is not resumed, but politics is such a circus in Britain now that nobody knows if Truss will still be prime minister on October 28.
However, that didn’t stop Martin from pursuing his search for resolution around the Protocol. He said, “There is clearly a desire with all the major stakeholders for a negotiated resolution of the issues around the Protocol. That was clear from my meeting with the British Prime Minister Liz Truss and from my engagement with the European Union.
“Talks have commenced, they should be allowed to continue and get a resolution around issues with the Protocol. In the interim, I think it is vital that the Assembly is restored.”
DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told reporters the Irish government now agreed with him that there is “no quick fix” to the problems created by the Protocol and that a “comprehensive deal” was required.
He was emphatic, however, that his party, the main objectors to power sharing in current circumstances, is not looking for a “tinkering” of the Protocol arrangement but “fundamental change.”
When Britain is ready to deal with the problem is now anyone’s guess.

TAOISEACH MICHEAL MARTIN has told Fianna Fáil that preparation for the 2024 local elections “starts now”, as the party prepares to launch a new plan for canvassing and campaigning.
Speaking at his party’s Cáirde Fáil dinner this evening, where over 1,000 party members were in attendance, Martin said that campaigning efforts for the local elections will be “earlier and more comprehensive than ever before”, with selection conventions beginning immediately.
He spoke at length about the importance of a full return to in-person campaigning, after the pandemic made canvassing and “day-to-day interaction” difficult.
“When this is not possible you miss the perspective which only personal interaction can deliver and it reduces the number of voices which can be heard,” the Taoiseach said.
He added that one of the key messages from Fianna Fáil’sArd Fheisearlier this month was members’ desire to get back on the doorsteps.

“For nearly two years we were not able to get out on the doorsteps doing the type of work which has always been our greatest strength and has been the reason why we have so often performed well ahead of expectations.”
“I’ve longed believed that there is a fundamental division between two separate views of politics. There are those who see politics as a game of who’s up and who’s down – spending their time focused on the confined world of Leinster House.
“And then there are those who see politics as a way to serve people, which involves activists working in every community and focused on addressing complex issues.”
‘Sniping and manoeuvring’
Setting out what he expects the party to achieve in the next two and a half years, Martin said: “When we next seek the support of the Irish people we will show them sustained progress.
“We’ll continue to do everything we can to show that constructive cooperation is possible across party boundaries.
“Each party in government stood on separate manifestos and we have separate core priorities which link to our histories and the communities we represent. But we succeeded in negotiating an ambitious programme which respects each party and sets a framework for a government which can work for the people.”

Vivienne Clarke,"Fianna Fáil will take over finance ministry in December, Taoiseach confirms","Final budget figures to address the cost-of-living crisis yet to be finalised, Micheál Martin says",https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/09/13/fianna-fail-will-take-over-finance-ministry-in-december-taoiseach-confirms/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-09-13T10:33:05+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed that Fianna Fáil will take over the finance ministry from Fine Gael Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe later this year.
Mr Martin said the cohesion of the Government depends on parity of esteem, and as agreed Fianna Fáil will take over the finance portfolio in December when Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is due to be come taoiseach.
When asked what portfolio he will have in the revamped Cabinet, Mr Martin told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that after the budget the three party leaders would discuss such details, his focus for now was the cost-of-living crisis, but he repeated that “parity of esteem” must be maintained.
When the parity of esteem agreement was reached on the formation of the Government “we didn’t get into personalities”, he said when asked if Michael McGrath would be the next minister for finance.
Under the agreement, if one party has the Taoiseach, the other would have the minister for finance portfolio. “That was clear and understood,” he said.
Speaking later Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the make-up of the next Cabinet after he takes over as taoiseach again in December has not yet been discussed among the leaders of the Government parties.
There are concerns within Fine Gael that Paschal Donohoe’s move out of that role could risk Ireland losing the chair of the influential Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, which Mr Donohoe holds, when he and Mr McGrath, Minister for Public Expenditure, are expected to swap roles in December under the coalition government agreement.
Mr Varadkar told reporters there had been no discussions among the leaders of the Government parties - Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens - “about the shape of the new government” and that this would take place after the budget in November or December.
The Tánaiste said he had served in three coalitions and knew “what makes them work” and “what makes them last,” and that it was “essential” there was “parity of esteem.”
“We don’t want the kind of thing we see happening in Northern Ireland where governments last and they are closed down more often than they are operating. For governments to last, you have to stick by your agreements, good faith, no surprises and parity of esteem,” he said.
The Taoiseach is travelling to Belfast today for the memorial service to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, which is also being attended by British prime minister Liz Truss. It is not expected that the two leaders will hold talks in Belfast, but it is understood that efforts are under way to set up a meeting next week when the Taoiseach travels to London for the queen’s funeral.
There are hopes that negotiations on the Northern Ireland protocol could be restarted between the EU and the new British government in the coming weeks, though Brussels and Dublin are awaiting any sign of a new approach from the Truss administration.
If there is no resolution that satisfies the DUP and persuades the party to return to the Stormont power-sharing institutions before the end of October, fresh elections in Northern Ireland will be triggered.
It is understood Ms Truss has not yet spoken to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
Speaking from Mullingar where Fianna Fáil was holding a two day think-in, Mr Martin defended his reaction when details emerged about the property interests of former Minister of State Robert Troy in August.
Mr Troy was not alone in his issues with the declaration of interests, a range of public representatives had similar issues, said Mr Martin. What he felt in August was that Mr Troy was entitled to due process.
He was prepared to go into the Dáil to make a comprehensive statement. “It’s not right, he made a very serious error, he was wrong, he apologised. He resigned.” Mr Martin said he had described Mr Troy’s actions as “a serious error”. People were entitled to be given the time to articulate comprehensively what went wrong.

THE TAOISEACH HAS indicated he would be open to allowing former party colleague Bertie Ahern back into Fianna Fáil.
Micheál Martin said that he has been engaging with the former taoiseach in recent times, particularly about issues around the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Yesterday evening, it was proposed during the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party that Ahern should be allowed to make a return to the party as part of its plans to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.
Speaking in Tallaght today, Martin said: “In terms of Bertie Ahern, I have been engaging with Bertie Ahern actually over the last year and a bit, since the rows on the protocol, and he’s very involved in Northern Ireland issues, he maintains contacts with different groups.
“From my perspective, like that level of consultation will continue because I think he has invaluable insights to all of that.”
Ahern resigned from Fianna Fáil in 2012 after the Mahon Tribunal. He stepped down as Taoiseach in 2008 and as a TD in 2011. He made the move before Martin sought to expel him from the party.
The tribunal (officially the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments) found that he didnot truthfully account for payments of IR£165,000made to accounts connected to him.
It was scathing in its treatment of the former Taoiseach, rejecting much of the evidence he provided in connection to a substantial number of lodgements made in the 1990s.
Although the tribunal did not make findings of corruption against Ahern, it proved hugely damaging to his reputation.He has disputed the findings.
Martin said that his former colleague has experience with a range of groups in Northern Ireland.

“He has reached out to communities in the north and is sort of picking up perspectives in different communities and that’s been valuable in terms of engaging and discussions on that,” the Fianna Fail leader added.
“No one can take from the contribution he made to peace in Ireland and to the peace process, so the fullness of time certainly we will give him that consideration.

“It’s very relaxed when we meet.”
When remined that he sought to expel his predecessor from the party, Martin said that he resigned in the wake of the tribunal.
“As far as I am concerned, it’s ten years on, I’m conscious of the contribution he has made to peace in the country.
“He made a very significant contribution,” Martin added.
“There’s no immediate decisions yet. He has his views on these things as well.
“We’ve had good conversations, we meet at informal occasions, at matches and that.
“His is commitment to making sure that we can try and resolve the current issues around the protocol are very sincere and heartfelt, and that’s something we can take value from.”
Fianna Fail TD for Dublin South West John Lahart also said he was open to the idea of seeing Ahern return.
“Well, we don’t live in a cancel culture,” he added.
“I look around at the correspondents and the journalists here and I don’t think there’s one of you that at some stage of your career in the last decade has not sought out Bertie Ahern specifically.
“There’s no reason why Fianna Fáil should be any different and a lot of this happens under the radar.
“I think the discussion last night was specifically in the context of the value of experience that he brings, particularly in the context of the 25th year of the Good Friday Agreement next year.
“I think that’s the story element of this.”
A spokesperson for Ahern toldThe Journalthis issue has come up many times before and the former Taoiseach does not wish to comment. However, she it is accurate to state that Ahern “keeps contact with the Taoiseach and relevant Government departments on Northern Ireland”.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has apologised to cervical cancer campaigner Stephen Teap.
It comes after campaigner Teap yesterday settled his High Court action with two laboratories that examined his wife Irene’s cervical smear tests.
Irene Teap died of cervical cancer aged 35 in 2017, less than a year before the CervicalCheck scandal was revealed by campaigner Vicky Phelan, who died from cervical cancer last month at the age of 48.
Stephen Teap’s court action was settled in a rare case where two laboratories admitted a breach of their duty of care in misreading CervicalCheck smear tests.
Speaking on the steps of the High Court yesterday, Teap said: “The blood of my wife and the incredible friends I’ve made who have passed away is on the Government’s hands and those politicians who have failed to listen.”
Taoiseach Micheál Martin said there was “no defence” for what happened with the CervicalCheck controversy, and offered an apology to Teap.
“First of all, I fully understand where Stephen Teap is coming from. What happened to him and his family is absolutely devastating,” he said on Virgin Media’s Tonight Show last night.

“In terms of the CervicalCheck scandal, it shouldn’t have happened, there is no defence for what happened.
“And the labs [yesterday] have admitted that their misreading of these tests were a causative factor in Irene Teap’s death.
“Our sincere sympathies and apologies go to Stephen Teap and his family.”
In 2018, it was disclosed that more than 200 women who used the screening programme CervicalCheck, and who were later diagnosed with cancer, had not been told that their previous smear results had been audited, or that in some cases the results found that their smears had been misinterpreted.
Dr Gabriel Scally, who has carried out assessments of CervicalCheck, concluded that cervical smears were sent to “far distant” laboratories abroad; that the HSE’s quality assurance process was “not fit for purpose”; and that some doctors working for the programme spoke to women and families about its “ill-designed” smear audit in an “obstructive and callous” way.
When asked about the failures in relation to governance over laboratories examining smears, Martin said: “I wouldn’t accept it was price over quantity.”
“I don’t think it was driven by price, I think it was driven with a desire to get a cervical screening programme established much more quickly than otherwise would have been the case.
“But the key issue of failure to disclose in respect of the audit results was unacceptable. But also in terms of the actual mistakes that were made by labs had a causative effect on the deaths of women, which is shocking in itself.”
He added that Ireland now has a chance to eliminate cervical cancer through a combination of rolling out the HPV vaccine, and higher quality smear testing than had been in place in previous years.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN said he sees an opportunity to “reset” Ireland’s relationship with the UK after meeting UK Prime Minister Liz Truss today.
Martin said he had a “warm” meeting with Truss and refrained from answering questions on the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit agreement.
“I don’t think this is the time, if you don’t mind me saying so, to get into the detail about issues like the protocol,” he said during an interview on BBC Radio 4, adding that he respects the period of national mourning the UK is currently engaged in.
The talks during the UK’s mourning period, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, are being portrayed as chats rather than formal bilateral sessions, but the meeting comes against a backdrop of political tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements.
The Taoiseach and President Michael D Higginsboth paid their respectsto the queen at her lying-in-state in Westminster Hall today.
Martin continued: “I had a good telephone conversation last week with the British Prime Minister, had an initial warm meeting this morning where we discussed many issues in the context of the British-Irish relationship.
“But I do think the opportunity is there for us to reset relationships and to be conscious of what we achieved in previous years, the obstacles that were overcome then.
And that gives us the strength to know that we have the capacity to overcome current obstacles, current issues that potentially could impede the relationship, and I believe we can overcome them.

The meeting comes as Britain is expected to push ahead with legislation to give ministers the power to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which was jointly agreed by the UK and EU in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Both the EU and Ireland claim Britain’s move to unilaterally revise the post-Brexit treaty would breach international law.
The issue is expected to ramp up ahead of a deadline at the end of October to form a new Northern Ireland Executive, which the DUP has so far blocked in protest over the protocol.
Truss had been due to meet US president Joe Biden, a milestone of her early premiership, but the talks were cancelled, with a “full bilateral meeting” scheduled instead for Wednesday, when they are set to be in New York for the UN General Assembly.
Along with meeting the Taoiseach, Truss will also meet Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Polish president Andrzej Duda in Downing Street.
Martin previously met Truss in person briefly shortly after she became Prime Minister earlier this month.
They were seated next to one another during a memorial service for the queen at St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast on Tuesday.

11 BEDS HAVE closed at the Linn Dara Unit for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in Dublin due to staff vacancies, according the the Minister of State for Mental Health Mary Butler.
The issue was raised in the Dáil today after Sinn Féin’s Mental Health spokesperson Mark Ward said over the weekend that the closures “will create nothing short of a crisisfor child and adolescent services in the Dublin region”.
Speaking in the Dáil today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the situation was “regrettable”.
Due to a number of nursing posts becoming vacant simultaneously, a decision was taken on the basis of patient safety, he explained.
Linn Dara has 24 beds and 51 funded posts at the facility, however 24 staff posts are vacant and need to be replaced at present, Butler told the Dáil today.
“So from a patient safety perspective, the facility has been working between 60% to 70% capacity for the last few months,” she said.
The minister said she has been aware that there has been challenges in recent months.

She said every effort has been made to fill vacancies.
The Taoiseach said the HSE explored all options before taking the decision to close beds, such as redeploying staff from other CAMHS community teams, but there were concerns about impacting other teams around the country.
“Unfortunately the issue around staffing is the reason why the beds have been closed”, said Butler.
Speaking about the children that are awaiting admission to the facility, Butler said that four young people waiting admittance, two are in hospital, while the other two children are receiving community supports.
The Taoiseach said funding and resourcing is not an issue, adding that work is intensifying in a bid to hire people with specialist skills for the unit.
Seven beds at Linn Dara are for children with eating disorders, with Martin telling the Dáíl that no child was discharged early in order to the falling staff numbers.
At the end of March 2022, no child under the age of 18 has been admitted to an adult mental health unit, said the Taoiseach.
This is down 2021 figures, in which 25 children were admitted to adult units, while 50 were admitted to such facilities in 2019.
“We do not want to see that happening in our mental health services,” he said.

,Taoiseach travelling to Ukraine to meet Zelenskiy,Micheál Martin set to travel from Poland to Kyiv by land overnight,https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/07/05/taoiseach-travelling-to-ukraine-to-meet-zelenskiy/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-07-05T15:13:35+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin is on his way to Ukraine, where he is expected to meet president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Government sources confirmed on Tuesday.
Mr Martin was in Poland on Tuesday from where he was due to travel to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. He was not present Dáil on Tuesday for Leaders’ Questions and is not expected to be present for Dáil business for the remainder of the week.
[Sweden and Finland to complete Nato membership in ‘months’Opens in new window]
Mr Martin was invited to Ukraine last month by Mr Zelenskiy, who also singled him out for thanks after the European Council approved Ukraine’s bid for candidate status at a recent summit in Brussels. The Taoiseach’s office said then that he was keeping an invitation to visit Ukraine under review, though sources said Mr Martin was keen for an opportunity to do so.
Precise details of the visit are not being released for security reasons, but it was expected that Mr Martin would travel to Kyiv over land from Poland on Tuesday night or Wednesday.
Mr Martin was a strong early supporter of Ukraine’s bid for membership of the EU. He will become the latest in a series of western leaders to visit the Ukrainian capital since Russia’s invasion of the country in late February.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney visited Kyiv in April and Mr Zelenskiy has also addressed the Oireachtas by videolink, praising the Irish people’s support for his country.

"Pat Leahy, Jennifer Bray",RTÉ chairwoman accused Taoiseach of ‘deliberately undermining’ broadcaster over licence fee,Tensions between RTÉ and Government revealed in letters this summer between chair of board Moya Doherty and Micheál Martin,https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/11/01/rte-chair-accused-taoiseach-of-deliberately-undermining-broadcaster-over-licence-fee/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-11-01T05:00:53+00:00,"The chairwoman of RTÉ accused the Taoiseach and his Government of “deliberately undermining” the broadcaster by not committing to reforming the TV licence system.
In a series of letters to Micheál Martin, Moya Doherty complained of “persistent Government inaction” at a time when RTÉ was facing “profound” challenges.
The Government in July rejected a recommendation from the Future of Media Commission to abolish the licence fee from 2024 onwards and replace it with exchequer funding. Ministers instead agreed to overhaul how the charge is collected and establish a group, due to report shortly, to assess the licence system.
RTÉ gets some €200 million a year in income from the €160 licence fee, which is collected by An Post, but has long complained that the rate of evasion and avoidance costs it tens of millions annually. An additional €140 million of its €340 million annual budget comes from commercial activities.
Correspondence released under Freedom of Information legislation to The Irish Times shows that Ms Doherty wrote to Mr Martin on June 14th expressing RTÉ's ongoing concern about the “failure” to publish the commission’s report, which had “created a decision-making vacuum for RTÉ” as the “outstanding matter of licence fee reform remains unaddressed”.
“As a board, our commitment is to maintain and develop RTÉ's core mission of public service broadcasting. But we are currently being hindered in this important work by the failure to publish the outcome of the work of the commission.”
[The BBC is 100 but can the Big British Castle survive its own government?Opens in new window]
[What exactly does the Future of Media Commission report say?Opens in new window]
On July 8th, Ms Doherty again wrote to Mr Martin following a briefing from officials in the Department of Culture, Arts and Media ahead of the publication of the report.
“It seems that the outcome of this lengthy process is that once again meaningful reforms of the funding system that underpins public media in Ireland will be avoided by Government,” she said.
“Accepting 49 of the 50 recommendations in the report as indicated by the department, but without any commitment to reform the licence fee or any firm commitment to interim funding for RTÉ or the wider media sector renders this whole process meaningless.
“Notwithstanding public statements of support, persistent Government inaction at this point can only be understood as a deliberate undermining of what RTÉ is here to do.”
Mr Martin responded on July 11th, saying the commission’s report would be considered by the Cabinet the following day and defending not accepting the licence fee recommendation.
“This approach does not in any way diminish our support for continued public funding of media, and RTÉ in particular,” he said. “We believe that an approach which will reform and enhance collection of the TV licence, alongside continued exchequer funding, is the most sustainable means of supporting RTÉ and wider media in Ireland, while also protecting its independence.
“I also want to assure you that the approach to be adopted in no way represents ‘a deliberate undermining of what RTÉ is here to do’ but is in fact a genuine effort to ensure we have a sustainable approach to the future of Irish public service broadcasting consistent with the thrust of the commission’s recommendations.”
On September 15th, Ms Doherty wrote again to Mr Martin, saying that she welcomed commitments made in relation to interim funding arrangements, which were to be acted upon in the budget.

LAST UPDATE|2 Nov 2022
A SPOKESPERSON FOR the Taoiseach has said the party strongly rejects the assertions made by TD Marc MacSharry in relation to the written complaint received by Fianna Fáil.
MacSharry resigned from Fianna Fáil today citing the failure to properly handle a complaint made against him.
The Sligo-Leitrim TD confirmed his resignation in a strongly worded statement this morning, saying his decision to quit was due to Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s handling of the complaint from Fianna Fáil councillor Donal Gilroy.
He accused Martin of using the complaint “for political gain at national level”.
“This has resulted from the failure of the Taoiseach as Leader of the party to allow a proper investigation of a recent complaint on a political issue made against me by a Fianna Fáil councillor in my constituency,” MacSharry wrote in a statement.
“This recent complaint related to exchanges between us over several months on services I have secured for Sligo University Hospital and their significance. It was a robust issue and robust language was used.
“Instead of arranging an investigation of this local political dispute, the Taoiseach used the complaint for political gain at national level to delay and prevent my re-admission to the parliamentary party.”
The Taoiseach’s spokesperson said in a statement today:
“We have received Marc MacSharry TD’s resignation from Fianna Fáil. We wish him well for the future.
“We strongly reject the assertions made by Deputy MacSharry in relation to the written complaint received by the party.”
There were calls at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party last month to have MacSharry rejoin after he resigned last year and voted no confidence in Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney over his handling of the nomination of Katherine Zappone to a UN role.
However, his readmittancehit a stumbling block, with party whip Jack Chambers and the Taoiseach telling members that “an issue has arisen” in bringing him back into the fold.

Resignation & recent complaint.pic.twitter.com/XCwtZLmz23
MacSharry, who has previously been critical of Micheál Martin, continued in his statement: “He knows that I am critical of his performance as Taoiseach and his support within the parliamentary party is wafer thin.
“My re-admission would have been a problem for him, so he has used this complaint for his own purposes.”
He said the informarmal investigation promoted by Martin is “a non-starter” as “the confidentiality required has been broken by the public statements of the Taoiseach and The Chief Whip”.
“The Taoiseach has tried to brush this under the carpet with claims that I have not engaged. This is despite numerous correspondence from I to him, The Chief Whip and party officials on the matter setting out my position clearly,” he continued.
MacSharry shared the text of the complaint made by Gilroy in which the councillor said that he considers the behaviour of the TD to be “bullying aimed at me personally”
He described the complaint as “highly politically motivated” and said its timing was “unquestionably suspicious” as it was made ahead of the meeting to discuss his readmittance to the party.
“The handling of this complaint has involved the blatant manipulation of written Fianna Fáil party procedures together with a breach of confidentiality and denial of due process by party officials and the leadership,” he wrote.
“The invention of new rules on the hoof by linking a local political allegation to prevention of re-admission to the Parliamentary Party to suit the will and the agenda of the Taoiseach is unacceptable.”
MacSharry thanked party members in Sligo, Leitrim, South Donegal, North Roscommon for their “steadfast support in recent weeks and through the years” and said he will continue to work as an independent TD.
MacSharry resigned the Fianna Fáil whip last yearfollowing the Katherine Zappone controversy that erupted around Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.
The controversy, which stemmed from the appointment of Zappone as a UN Special Envoy, lead to a vote of no-confidence in the Foreign Affairs Minister.
In his resignation letter, MacSharry hit out at the Taoiseach and his leadership of the party, which is understood to have been an issue of discussion between the pair last week, with Martin taking issue with the comments.
MacSharry had said that Fianna Fáil party positioning and policy were being determined “in a fashion consistent with an undemocratic totalitarian regime”.

BreakingNews.ie,Taoiseach ‘focused on getting work done’ rather than future role,Micheál Martin is set to hand the reins over to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar in December 2022.,https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/taoiseach-focused-on-getting-work-done-rather-than-future-role-1236275.html,breakingnews,general,en,ie,2022-01-01T08:06:27+00:00,"By Rebecca Black, PA
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is focusing on getting the work done rather than his future role in Government at the end of next year.
Mr Martin is set to hand over the post of Taoiseach to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar in December 2022, under the terms of the government deal agreed between the two traditional political rivals and the Green Party.
The historic deal followed a general election result in 2020 which saw Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael finish in an almost dead heat.
Mr Varadkar is Tánaiste in the mixed Government, which also includes Green Party leader Eamon Ryan.


Asked about the future Government, Mr Martin said his key focus is policy and “getting the work done”.
He said future ministerial posts will be considered closer to the time.
“When I became Taoiseach I was anxious that we would create structures that would enable us to deliver on the policy objectives within the programme for government,” he said.
“And to that extent we set up a fairly significant subcommittee structure within cabinet, particularly the key critical areas of housing, of climate, of economy, health, and education.
“And those committees are very important for not just getting into the fine detail of policy, but also following through and monitoring delivery.
“So my focus, and this is still early years in this Government, is to really deliver now on the key commitments.
“We’ve made great progress, I would argue, so far. So I’m not speculating what’s going to happen in 12 months time in terms of specific ministries or anything like that, that would be a matter that would be considered closer to that time.”
Mr Martin said his ministers were “doing very well” and stressed the importance of consistency.
“I am of a view that consistency of policy and delivery is important,” he said.
“Chopping and changing all of the time might look good for a day or two, but nothing can beat the substance of getting real change.”


Mr Martin described Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath as “very effective and solid”, working with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to take the economy through on of its largest upsets in 100 years.
“I think it’s the fastest recession we’ve had and deepest recession, but we’ve bounced back, along with our European colleagues, but in Ireland, we’ve bounced back very significantly,” he said.
“And so I think economically, the Government has done very well, in the context of a pandemic, fastest growing in Europe and quarter three employment almost back now above pre-pandemic levels.”
He described Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien as having put together a very comprehensive Housing for All strategy, with substance and funding, while he said Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue has been “very, very effective”.
Mr Martin described Norman Foley has having been a “very authoritative” Minister for Education, and commended Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly for presiding, he said, over one of the best vaccination programmes in Europe, if not across the globe.
The Taoiseach added: “People are only a year and a half in office and I think they’re all working very well, as are the ministers of state, all having significant legislation under their belt and getting important legislation passed, as well as initiatives particularly in mental health, older people and disabilities.”

,Ireland accused of ‘empty gesture’ on visas as mother and son are stranded in Kyiv,"An Irish executive based in Kyiv has described the Government’s visa waiver for citizens of Ukraine as “too little too late”. Des O’Maonaigh who has been trying for the last two weeks to get a visa for his partner Svetlana’s son Kirill (14), said the visa waiver announced by Taoiseach Micheál Martin came only after Ukrainian air space was closed and no flights out of the country were available. Mr O’Maonaigh who works in the banking sector told The Irish Times he had travelled to Ireland in early February to be close to his mother who was in hospital.

Des O’Maonaigh, who has been trying for the last two weeks to get a visa for his partner Svetlana’s son Kirill (14), said the waiver announced by Taoiseach Micheál Martin came only after Ukrainian air space was closed and no flights out of the country were available.
Mr O’Maonaigh who works in the banking sector said he had travelled to Ireland in early February to be close to his mother who was in hospital. As he watched the worsening situation in Ukraine he and Svetlana, who already holds a visa for Ireland, decided to apply for a visa for Kirill so they could both join him in Dublin.
However, he said despite Government assurances that families of Irish workers in Ukraine would have their applications for visas expedited he was “given the run around”.
He said an application was made online on Tuesday, February 15th and the first available appointment to present papers at a visa processing centre in Kyiv was on February 18th. Despite the family’s best efforts to anticipate the requirements and supply all documents, including proof of Svetlana’s sole guardianship of Kirill, and a host of subsequent emails and telephone calls , Mr O’Maonaigh said “there was a complete lack of urgency”.
By Thursday morning when the invasion had started the family still had no visa. “There was just no humanity, no compassion, no sense of urgency”, he said.
With the invasion underway the family decided to seek the urgent return of Kirill’s passport and make land-based arrangements to leave Kyiv.
Mr O’Maonaigh said the first move was to get Svetlana and Kirill out of the home they shared as this was in the government quarter, close to the presidential palace where Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will remain. As such, the area was considered a target and Svetlana and Kirill spent Thursday night in a bomb shelter near a school.
“There is 1.4 million people trying to get out of Kyiv and the roads to the Polish border are choked with traffic. I have friends who spent seven hours yesterday and only travelled 30 kilometres,” Mr O’Maonaigh said.
On Friday night, Svetlana, along with her 80 year old mother and 90 year-old father, was again taking refuge in the bomb shelter, while she hoped to get a train to Lviv near the Polish border next week.
“Lifting visa requirements when nobody can get a flight out is just an empty gesture,” he said.
The Department of Justice, which administers the visa system, has been asked to comment.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said it was not in a position to comment on specific cases. On Friday, it said it remained in contact with 94 Irish citizens in Ukraine who had registered with them.
It confirmed that the requirement for Ukrainian citizens to have a visa to travel to Ireland had been dropped with “immediate effect”.

BreakingNews.ie,Live: What restrictions have been lifted by Government?,"As Micheál Martin is addressing the nation this evening, here is what restrictions are being eased by Government.",https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/live-what-restrictions-have-been-lifted-by-government-1246645.html,breakingnews,general,en,ie,2022-01-21T18:06:53+00:00,"Kenneth Fox and Danielle Walsh Ronan
With the peak of Omicron seemingly over and hospitalisation figures being relatively stable, the Government has decided to ease restrictions in an attempt to move into a new phase of dealing with the Covid-19.
The main restrictions thatwill be lifted from 6am on Saturdayinclude:
The current requirements around face masks will stay in place until the 28th of February, as well as protective measures in schools, early learning and care facilities.
Although almost all restrictions are coming to an end, the Government has urged anyone with Covid-19 symptoms to isolate and get a test, while those who are close contacts should continue to follow the guidance on the HSE website.
Addressing Ireland from Government Buildings in Dublin, Taoiseach Micheál Martin paid tribute to the public for doing what they were asked to do in “previously unimagined restrictions” on their lives.
“Today is a good day, earlier my government colleagues and I met to consider the latest report from the National Public Health Emergency Team,” he said.
“That report confirmed that we have weathered the Omicron storm, it confirmed that the rate of infection is reducing and that all of the key indicators on which we base our decisions have stabilised and are going in the right direction. It confirmed that Ireland’s world-class vaccination programme and the rollout of the boosters has utterly transformed our situation.
“Based on this evidence, we’ve concluded that the rationale and justification for continuing most of our public health restrictions are no longer in place.
“Therefore from 6am tomorrow morning, the majority of public health measures that we have had to live with will be removed.”
Spring is coming.We need to see each other again,we need to see each other smile,we need to sing again.pic.twitter.com/149ZHQLfJx
— Micheál Martin (@MichealMartinTD)January 21, 2022

However, Micheál Martin warned that the coronavirus pandemic is not over.
“It will still require all of us to be vigilant. The changes we’re making will likely lead to a temporary rise in infections in the short term, but we are advised that the impact of this rise will be limited by the scale of vaccination in the population,” he said.
“It is important also to say that I can’t promise you there won’t be further twists in this pandemic requiring different decisions in the future, but I do know this, solidarity with each other and trust in science has got us to where we are today and will get us through whatever else this virus make throw at us.”
He continued: “As we look forward to this spring, we need to see each other again, we need to see each other smile, we need to sing again.
“For all our faults as a country we have come a long way since this day in 1919, Ireland is now firmly established as an equal among all the nations, and we’ve been a positive force in the world through our arts, our culture, our peacekeeping and our commerce.
“We have done this by having the confidence to be ourselves.
“As we face into our second century as a free democracy and as we navigate this new phase of Covid it is time to be ourselves again.”
The lifting of restrictions on the hospitality sector has been greeted with ""relief"" from industry representatives.
Padraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland (VFI), said: “After a nightmare 22 months this is the news our members have been waiting for. The removal of all restrictions this weekend is the green light for pubs to get back to doing what they do best, and I know for a fact they can’t wait.
“Across Ireland there are 7,000 pubs employing 50,000 staff, so the benefits of reopening will be felt everywhere.
""Overnight, we are saying goodbye to vaccine passes, mandatory table service, contact details, six per table, sitting at all times, one-metre social distancing, no pool or darts and the ban on using bar counters. It really is remarkable to see it all coming to an end.""

Also reacting to the news, Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) said it was a ""monumental day for all of hospitality"".
""Overall the feelings of joy, relief and excitement are permeating throughout the sector,"" Mr O'Keefe said.
""We are delighted this has all happened so quickly, the speed with which things have progressed this week has been amazing. Some in the sector were worried this day may never come.
""This is a special moment, but it needs to be said this wouldn’t have been possible if it were not for the unbelievable effort put in by our health service and all our front line workers throughout the pandemic.
""They have done the truly hard and difficult work that has allowed the country to reach this point.
""We have also been very lucky to have seen such a tremendous vaccine rollout and all involved in all these activities deserve the thanks of everyone in hospitality and the rest of the nation.""
The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) described the lifting of restrictions as a “new dawn” for the tourism and hospitality industry.
""The removal of restrictions is truly fantastic news for hotel and guesthouse owners and their teams,"" IHF chief executive Tim Fenn said.
""They have endured a turbulent, uncertain and, at times, deeply stressful period as indeed have their families and the many communities for whom tourism is the only show in town.
""It’s very welcome news too for the many businesses up and down the country that supply our sector, many of them small employers who also rely heavily on tourism and hospitality.
""Meanwhile guests, including couples and families, can finally plan holidays, weddings and gatherings with much-needed confidence, certainty, and anticipation of a very warm welcome.""
So emotional after listening to@MichealMartinTD. Epic speech in terms of inclusivity & messaging. A new dawn awaits. Embracing it with every ounce of energy that I have. Heartfelt thanks to everyone who made it happen#NewBeginnings#TourismRecovery#TodayIsAGoodDay@IHFcomms
— Elaina Fitzgerald Kane 🇺🇦 (@ElainaFitzKane)January 21, 2022

The IHF also welcomed assurances from the Government that business supports would not be pulled despite the lifting of restrictions.
""While hotels and guesthouses are optimistic for later in the year, business and employment supports are vital in the interim, enabling them to protect employment and position themselves for the recovery,"" Mr Fenn said.
""The Government’s retention of the EWSS scheme for hospitality businesses is very welcome.
""It is critical that the enhanced levels are retained until the end February with the sliding scale until the end of May.
""Other supports such as a waiver on local authority rates will also be required until businesses get back on their feet. ""
The Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland (MEAI) said it had been 680 days of “adversity, being unable to work in any meaningful way, of financial hardship, and of major mental anguish and despair”.
“As we face this return to normality we are conscious that this will be another difficult journey for the months ahead,” they said.
“Our sector has been decimated and needs to be rebuilt. The pandemic has questioned our value and identity as professionals, and we must challenge that and improve the recognition and quality of our lives as professionals in this sector.
“We face tomorrow with some apprehension, maybe a sense of disbelief, but most of all with hope and optimism that the worst is behind us and brighter days are ahead.
“We must work towards a better future in ensuring that we, as a sector, never have to endure the hardship that we have experienced for the last 680 days.”
They said financial support will be required to continue as the sector rebuilds.

,UK plans to block Troubles prosecutions ‘simply not on’ – Taoiseach,"There can be “no unilateral action” by the UK government on the legacy of the Troubles, the Taoiseach has said ahead of the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Speaking to The Irish Times in advance of events to commemorate the shootings in Derry on Sunday, Micheál Martin said the UK’s plans to block all Troubles-era prosecutions were “simply not on”.

Speaking to The Irish Times in advance of events to commemorate the shootings in Derry on Sunday, Micheál Martin said the UK's plans to block all Troubles-era prosecutions were ""simply not on"".
He said “they fly in the face of the families of all the victims and all of those who lost their lives” from all communities and that the British government must “move away from” its proposals.
“It goes against everything we’ve been doing on legacy, particularly agreements that have been entered into by the British and Irish governments, to deny families of victims access to the truth,” he said.
Mr Martin said the fact that the Bloody Sunday families “persisted on the journey for truth and justice, I think, in its own way, influences the wider importance of access to truth and justice for all victims of violence”.
Thirteen people died and others were injured when the British army opened fire on anti-internment marchers in Derry’s Bogside on January 30th, 1972. A 14th person died later.
The Taoiseach will lay a wreath at the memorial to the victims in Derry on Sunday and meet privately with the relatives of the deceased. Other political and church leaders from across the island are also expected to attend, and the President will deliver an online address to a commemorative event.
Mr Martin paid tribute to the Bloody Sunday families and thanked them for their “resilience, for their persistence, and above all for their dignity in pursuing truth and justice”, which he said stood as a “monument” that would “inspire others to continue to seek access to the truth”.
Bloody Sunday, he said was one of the ""foundational events of the entire Troubles"" as ""an injustice that remained at the heart of Northern Ireland for a long, long time"". However, he said the example of the families spoke to ""the capacity to reconcile, to remember but also to dedicate oneself to rebuilding and to building a new future"".
A “heartfelt sense of their loss is always there”, he said, “in the hearts and minds of the Irish people across the island”, but the memory of Bloody Sunday should remind everyone, particularly those in public life, “of the need to work together to build a genuinely better future for the younger generations and to make sure that they never, ever experience something like that”.

Paddy Clancy,"Irish government pledges to ""cushion the blow"" of inflation","Taoiseach Micheál Martin said inflation is being driven by external, global factors.",https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/irish-government-inflation,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-02-09T19:28:02+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has revealed that measures to “cushion the blow” of rising inflation will be in place by the end of this week.
He said, “The priority right now is that we can bring in a range of measures that would cushion the blow for many, many people out there who clearly are suffering the impact of price rises and that is the agenda at the moment.
“The minister for public expenditure and the minister for finance are working on ideas around that.”
Martin was being quizzed in Killarney on Monday about steeply rising food and fuel prices that soared during Brexit and the Covid pandemic.
He said the government has to plan on the basis that steep cost of living rises will be here for the medium term, and certainly for the next number of months.
He accepted there were limits to the extent the government can assist people who have been put under pressure by rising inflation.
One pair suffering rising costs are two women who share a house in the Stoneybatter area of Dublin, Marie Keogh and Paula O’Loughlin, who told RTÉ that prices have become “ridiculous.”
O'Loughlin, a carer who worked right through the pandemic, says she has now had to take on extra shifts just to keep up with the rising daily costs.
“We’re doing extra to just try and survive,” she said. “I used to be able to work, pay the bills and maybe have a holiday once a year. I won’t be having a holiday this year because it’s just not realistic.”
She needs her car for work, but the price of keeping it on the road is becoming more of a strain.
“It's got quite difficult...petrol is up another €50/60 per month and we’re having to cut down on other things.”
She added,  “Even the broadband! That’s also gone up on what it was two years ago.”
Their local newsagent is feeling the impact too. Rising delivery and wholesale costs mean the shopkeeper Luther Moussa, who has been there 20 years, has had to increase prices and his business is being hit.
“Everything has gone up,” he said. “People are spending less money than they used to.”
Martin said the details of a proposed package would be revealed by the end of the week, but he would not go into specifics on what measures the package may contain.
Separately, Environment Minister Eamon Ryan was due to unveil a system of grants of €25,000 to individual homeowners to help pay for deep retro-fits as part of the biggest home insulation scheme ever offered in the state.
The grants would be roughly half the cost of improving a dwelling’s energy efficiency to a high rating and consequently reducing heating bills by as much as two-thirds.
Martin noted on RTÉ that inflation was being driven by external, global factors such as fuel prices, and there was a need for the country to “double down” on the use of renewable energy, and to reduce Ireland's dependence on gas and other fossil fuels.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin is to brief Cabinet colleagues on plans for two citizens’ assemblies, set to start in April.
The main item that will be referred to the Dublin citizens’ assembly is to consider whether a directly elected mayor for the city should be considered, as well as issues relating to the local government structure.
A second citizens' assembly would examine the issue of biodiversity, which the Taoiseach indicated he was open to in the Dáil last week in response to questions from Fianna Fáil TD for Cork South-West Christopher O'Sullivan.
The assemblies will be asked to report back within nine months, it is understood.
The programme for Government commits to establishing a citizens’ assembly to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin, as well as to allow for plebiscites to be held in 2024 in any local authority that wishes to have a directly elected mayor.
Previous plans for a directly elected mayor for the capital fell apart when Fingal County Council rejected the plans, which needed the support of all four local authorities in the capital to proceed.
Limerick will get a directly elected mayor with executive powers and a salary of €130,000, after voters in the city approved the proposal in a plebiscite in 2019. The contest is expected to take place later this year.

Kerry O'Shea,"Irish access to E-3 visas to get renewed push in Washington, DC this St. Patrick's Day","Taoiseach Micheál Martin is expected to raise the issue of Irish access to E-3 visas during his meeting with President Joe Biden on St. Patrick's Day, the AOH says.",https://www.irishcentral.com/irish-access-e-3-visas,IrishCentral,general,en,ie,2022-03-16T08:50:30+00:00,"With Taoiseach Micheál Martinin Washington, DC this week for St. Patrick's Day, the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), the oldest and largest Irish Catholic organization in the US, are renewing their push to secure Irish access to unclaimed E3 visas.
“The Ancient Order of Hibernians in America is pleased Taoiseach Micheál Martin will raise the US-Ireland migration issue we have been advocating for with President Biden on St. Patrick’s Day,"" AOH President Danny O'Connell told IrishCentral on Tuesday night.
O'Connell's comments come after areportin The Irish Times claims US Senators Dick Durbin and Pat Toomey are set to reintroduce legislation in Congress seeking Irish access to the E-3 visa program.
O'Connell said on Tuesday: “Our team has been in regular contact with Senator Dick Durbin [of Illinois] on the Irish E-3 visa that would provide future flow of Irish graduates to the United States.
“Our team has been in regular contact with Charlie Flanagan TD, Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, on US retirees taking up residence in Ireland.
“We believe now is the time for the E-3 visa program to come to the floor of the Senate. We work daily on immigration and the combined efforts of our Government Liaison John Deasy, our immigration chair Tom Lambert,  and our good friend former Irish Senator Bill Lawless have all been focused on the E-3 visa and future flow between our two countries bound together by history.”
O’Connell added: “St. Patrick’s Day is a special time for US Ireland relations and we believe this year's meeting will be the catalyst to reinvigorate US and Ireland migration.”
John Deasy, a former TD in Ireland who is now the head of government affairs with the AOH,toldThe Irish Times on Monday: “We believe there will be another attempt to pass an immigration package this year.
“The re-introduction of the E3 bill by Senator Durbin is the necessary first step in that process. “
Deasy added: “It is very significant that the most senior legislator in the Senate when it comes to immigration is doing this. We hope the Taoiseach can make a similar case to US president Joe Biden when he meets him on Thursday.”
Deasy described the E3 visa as ""incredibly flexible.""
The E3 visa was first introduced in the US in 2005. It’s a 2-year American working visa that is currently available to Australians only as part of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).
About 10,500 E3 visas are available for Australians to apply for annually. However, only about half of that allotment is typically claimed. The Irish are keen to get access to the unused E3 visas while allowing Australians to still have priority access.
In May 2019, US Representative Richie Neal, who sits on the Friends of Ireland Caucus, reintroduced legislation to grant Irish access to the E3 visa program after it wasnarrowly defeated in the US Senate in 2018.
Representative Neal’s legislationunanimously passed the House in March 2020but was never voted upon in the US Senate.

Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin interacted with PresidentJoe Biden, 79, and House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, 81, on Wednesday night shortly before he tested positive for COVID-19.
Biden's contact with Martin, however, did not fall under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for a 'close contact,' a White House communications aide told DailyMail.com.
The official, however, declined to answer whether the president was tested yet forcoronavirus.
The exposure to the president and speaker happened during the Ireland Funds National Gala on Wednesday evening at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.
Martin, 61, was scheduled to attend a day of events Thursday at the White House in celebration of St. Patrick's Day. Biden is of Irish descent.
A spokesperson for Martin said: 'He is feeling well and is currently self isolating on public health advice. We are exploring alternatives to the in-person programme of events'.
The White House has not yet released a statement on the contact Biden had with Martin and whether the president has been tested for coronavirus yet.
​​'In consultation with the Office of Attending Physician, the Speaker will continue regular testing and follow CDC guidance,' Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement. 'The Friends of Ireland Lunch today will proceed but without the participation of the Taoiseach.'
At the luncheon, Pelosi said of the events Thursday night: 'Right before I was supposed to give him the award the Taoiseach left the table.'
'So we're very very sad that the Taoiseach has the diagnosis,' she added.

President Joe Biden, 79, was also at the event, but the White House claims he did not come in 'close contact' with Martin
Martin left The Ireland Funds event early on Wednesday evening after his positive result was confirmed, according to UK-based news agency PA Media.
After Martin left, a person who attended the dinnertold CNNthat the Irish Ambassador to the U.S. Daniel Mulhall announced the results to the room.
After the PCR test results, Martin's press secretary released a statement saying the prime minister, known in Ireland as Taoiseach, had received a negative result earlier on Wednesday afternoon.
'The Taoiseach had also received a negative PCR test result on Sunday, taken before travel to the US,' the statement added. 'However, a further test was carried out when one of the Taoiseach's delegation received a positive test, which resulted in a later positive result for the Taoiseach.'
The Irish leader's positive diagnosis comes just two days after the White House announced that second gentleman Doug Emhoff tested positive for coronavirus.
Following the diagnosis, President Biden made a major gaffe Tuesday by saying he was the one that contracted COVID-19, when meaning to say Emhoff tested positive for the virus that day.
'The first lady's husband contacted COVID,' Biden said during an Equal Pay Day celebration for Women's history month.
Someone off to the side quickly corrected Biden, pointing out that his statement would mean he was the one with COVID.
'That's right,' he said to laughter from the room.
'She's fine. Second lady – the first gentleman, how about that?' he said with a smile as he continued his gaffe regarding the relations of who had coronavirus.
Biden did wear a mask at the event when walking to the podium for his remarks before removing it to speak
Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who is an active critic of Democrats on Twitter, posted a clip of the comment with: 'The First Lady's husband has no idea what he's saying….'
Emhoff, 57, tested positive after spending the afternoon with AmeriCorps at an environmental community service project in an urban garden in Northeast Washington, D.C.
'Earlier today, the Second Gentleman tested positive for COVID-19,' the White House released in a statement Tuesday evening.
The statement said that Vice President Kamala Harris tested negative for COVID-19 on Tuesday, but will continue to test now that her husband contracted the virus.
'Out of an abundance of caution, the Vice President will not participate in tonight's event,' it added, referencing the Women's History Month event at the White House.
Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff (left) tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday, causing wife Vice President Kamala Harris (right) to skip out on a Women's History Month event at the White House 'out of an abundance of caution' despite testing negative
President Joe Biden made a major gaffe at the White House Tuesday by saying he was the ne who tested positive for coronavirus rather than Emhoff. 'The first lady's husband contacted COVID,' Biden said, before someone pointed out that statement would mean he was the one with the virus
The event still went on as planned Tuesday evening, but Biden made his major faux pas by accidentally claiming he was the one who got COVID.
Biden told the crowd to send 'our love' to Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president, since she could no longer attend the event celebrating women in the workforce and promoting equal pay between men and women as part of Women's History Month.
Emhoff's positive test came after former President Barack Obama announced on Sunday that he contracted coronavirus, but claimed wife Michelle was clear.
It also came after a group of seven House Democrats reported testing positive after attending a party retreat in Philadelphia over the weekend.
Biden attended and spoke at the event on Friday, but White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that he tested negative on Sunday.
Another pair of lawmakers who didn't go to the retreat also reported testing positive Friday and Monday.
The slew of positive results comes after the House finally lifted its mask mandate after two years of restrictions and lawmakers resumed the practice of gathering in close quarters in the chamber without masks.
COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed over the last month as case rates massively decline and hope emerges that the end of the pandemic is near

Among those reporting positive cases were senior members of the Democratic caucus, including powerful House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Representative Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut, 79 and impeachment managers Representatives Zoe Lofgren of California, 74, and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, 62.
Masks were optional at the retreat, which came during a time of lessening COVID restrictions.
Hours before news broke of Emhoff's positive test, the second gentleman was promoting the White House event celebrating Women's History Month.
'I took a step away from my career to support our first woman vice president, who happens to be my wife, Kamala Harris,' he told reporters during his trip to an urban garden in D.C. Tuesday afternoon.
'So it was something that was a no brainer to do, but I love practicing law. I loved every minute of it, but this is so rewarding,' he added.
'While I do miss what I was doing,' the country's first second gentleman said, 'if I was if I was going to step away from it, this is such an incredible honor to be able to do this and also, again, to support my wife.'
'It's important for men to step up and support women and not just say they're doing it, not just think they're doing it, but actually do it.'
'So I'm hoping to set a good example by what I've done,' he concluded in reference to giving up his career as a lawyer to move to Number One Observatory Circle with Harris.

US PRESIDENT JOE Biden has arrived in Europe on a trip aimed to bolster Western unity and ramp up unprecedented sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Biden told reporters as he boarded the Marine One helicopter at the White House that he sees “a real threat” of Russian chemical warfare against Ukraine.
The possibility that President Vladimir Putin could order chemical, biological or even tactical nuclear strikes to subdue Ukraine will be one of the dire scenarios discussed at back-to-back Nato, G7 and EU summits in Brussels tomorrow.
The Taoiseach Micheál Martin and other leaders arealso travellingto Brussels on Thursday for an EU Council meeting on the war. Martin is due to return to Ireland from Washington tonight after testing positive for Covid-19 ahead of St Patrick’s Day.
Biden, who is set to give a news conference at Nato headquarters tomorrow, will fly to Poland on Friday.
On Saturday he will meet Polish President Andrzej Duda before returning to Washington.
White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling with Biden to Brussels that “what we’d like to hear is that the resolve and unity that we’ve seen for the past month will endure for as long as it takes”.
Sullivan said that economic sanctions, imposed by a global network of Western allies to cripple Russia’s finances, will be deepened in the summits.

“We, the United States, will announce a package of sanctions designations tomorrow that relate both to political figures, oligarchs… as well as entities,” Sullivan said.
Western partners were also looking to “coordinate on sanctions enforcement so that Russian efforts to evade the sanctions can be dealt with effectively”.
China
Beijing has refused to condemn Putin’s war, but Washington hopes at least to dissuade China from actively helping the Kremlin, either by bailing out the Russian economy or sending weapons.
Sullivan said there was no sign that China was providing military assistance in the wake of a nearly two-hour phone call between President Xi Jinping and Biden last Friday.
“This is something we are monitoring closely,” he said.
“The president will certainly consult on the question of China’s potential participation in the conflict of Ukraine while he’s in Brussels. He’ll do so at NATO,” Sullivan said.
“He’ll also do so when he addresses the 27 leaders of the European Union, because on April 1st, the European Union is having a summit with China.
“We believe we’re very much on the same page with our European partners.”

Micheál Martin bustled straight over. “I’m back on the yokes!”
Beg your pardon, Taoiseach?
“I’m back on the yokes,” he repeated. “You know, the eggs.”
Phew. He’s back on the yolks.
The Minister for Agriculture was at his shoulder. Maybe the boss shouldn’t be imparting this sort of information willy-nilly, we said to him. Some people, particularly younger folk, might get the wrong end of the glowstick. Then again, they might start seeing the Taoiseach in a new light.
Charlie McConalogue just laughed. Micheál wanted to set the record straight following our stunning scoop yesterday that he nudges the yolks out of halved boiled eggs in the Dáil canteen and only puts the white bits on his plate.
He was not disputing the veracity of this insightful information in any way. This used to be the way he rolled. But not any more.
“They contain a thing called choline,” he explained. “Very good for brain function.”
So the Taoiseach is enthusiastically back on the yolks now. Or have we just hallucinated the whole episode? A distinct possibility, given that one of the main highlights of a dull afternoon in Leinster House was the installation of a swanky new sparkling water dispenser in the canteen. It provides still water, too.
Micheál will be beside himself.
In the Dáil, the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader were absorbed in another instalment of their endless argument about housing. He wants a “solutions”-focused approach. She wants a “reality”-focused approach. And ne’er the twain shall meet, it seems.
Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats took up where Mary Lou McDonald left off and talked about the Government's newly launched pension auto-enrolment scheme. ""While welcoming plans to address the pension time-bomb, we have a housing time-bomb that exploded years ago,"" she told Micheál.
Murphy was not against improving people's pension prospects but feared a generation would be forced to spend that extra pension money to keep the roof over their heads
It would be a great idea if it didn’t look suspiciously like a wheeze to get workers priced out of the property market to put their money into a pension fund which they can then use to cover the rent they will still have to pay in their retirement years, she reckoned.
Is this the real reason the Government is introducing this plan for workers in the private sector? “So they can raid the pension fund to continue to pay rack rents when they reach their mid-60s,” she said.
The Taoiseach sounded frustrated. He wished people would welcome this plan in the spirit in which it was intended. “There can be no argument against doing the right thing,” he responded. “It’s the right thing to do.”
Despite Opposition TDs mentioning media reports to the contrary, he stressed there was no sinister motive underpinning the measure. He was “somewhat taken aback” by the commentary on the auto-enrolment scheme, something he had believed most TDs would welcome.
The main reason behind it is to do something about the dearth of pension cover in the private sector, he said, adding that he was “delighted” his government has moved to tackle the issue.
Murphy was not against improving people’s pension prospects but she feared a generation of people, struggling now to pay rent and with no prospect of owning a home when they retire, would be forced to spend that extra pension money just to keep the roof over their heads. She argued that the answer was not just about building more houses, but to build more houses that workers could afford to buy.
Micheál didn’t disagree, but it was a case of trying to build them fast enough. “I know I annoy people when I say it: we do need to get real in terms of delivering housing schemes much faster than we are. Everybody needs to get real.”
What is the point in coming into the Dáil every week “having a go, saying this is a great crisis, this is terrible, government is not doing enough” while carrying on as usual in councils around the country?” he asked Opposition TDs. “No problem – we can object to that, we can amend that, we can change that. And yet you come in here attacking, attacking, attacking. That’s not going to wash any more.”
As for the auto-enrolment scheme, it is designed to give “pension coverage to workers in our society that supplements the State pension and will enable them to have a quality of life in their later years. That’s it.”
""Not if they can't pay their rent,"" shot back Richard Boyd Barrett.
Later in the afternoon, the Dáil set aside 3½ hours for deputies to make statements on the crisis in Ukraine. Most of them making, more or less, the same speech.
Mary Lou McDonald repeated her call for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador. His Execrably Mr Yura Fibbertov is still ensconced in Rathgar telling porkies for the motherland, but the Government is reluctant to boot out any more diplomats after expelling four alleged spooks on Tuesday.
Russia immediately signalled it would indulge in tit-for-tatski retaliation that will probably see the expulsion of four of the six Irish diplomats in Moscow, where Ireland is anxious to maintain some presence.
Fine Gael backbencher Joe Carey, looking ahead to Thursday's address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to both Houses of the Oireachtas, suggested that arrangements be put in place broadcast the speech on big screens in towns and cities across the country.
The Clare TD reckoned Merrion Square Park across from Leinster House would be an ideal location in Dublin “and we would encourage Ukrainian people, people who are living here, and refugees, to attend and we can all stand with Ukraine and its people on the day.”
Meanwhile, the Oireachtas pulsated with fervent apathy from 11am when counting began in the Seanad byelection for Ivana Bacik's vacant seat on the Trinity College panel.
What with sorting the ballots, each one contained in an envelope within an envelope, and getting them in the right piles and stuff, it was after 7pm when the actual first count got under way.
The Seanad election process is fiendishly complicated to overcompensate for the dodgy nature of the rotten borough system that yields up our senators
TDs and Senators, voracious political animals all, clean forgot to rush down the road to Trinity to follow the action as it rattled along like a tortoise with gout.
Bacik, whose election to the Dáil last year gave rise to the vacancy, called into the count centre to wish the Labour candidate well while managing not to look ecstatic at escaping the backwater of the Upper House.
The Seanad election process is fiendishly complicated to overcompensate for the dodgy nature of the rotten borough system that yields up our senators. Hopeless political anoraks who can’t resist any sort of election count were predicting that it could be late into Thursday night or even Friday morning before a winner is declared. Sure we’ll have burst entirely with the excitement by then. We might need some of Micheál’s yolks to keep going.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS said the scheduled increase in Carbon Tax next month will go ahead but ministers are looking at how they may “offset” the burden on households.
Speaking to reporters today, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar both addressed the rising cost of living, with the latter saying the inflation crisis could last “for years”.
Carbon Taxis set to increase next month from €33.50 to €41.00per tonne of carbon. It is a charge applied tocarbon-emitting fuelssuch as coal, peat, oil and natural gas.
Varadkar said today that the government estimates it will add about €20 to the cost of filling a tank of home heating oil and €1.50 a month on gas bills.
“€30 might not sound like a lot of money but it is a lot of money if someone doesn’t have it,” he said.
Martin had said yesterday that, in the context of other price rises, theincrease in Carbon Tax has garnered an outsized amountof political debate.
Speaking today, An Taoiseach said the money raised from Carbon Tax is ring-fenced for efforts to tackle the climate emergency.

“The whole importance of the Carbon Tax is to enable us to have resources to enable people to develop energy efficiency and ultimately reduce costs of energy in their homes.  So we’ve got to avoid a knee-jerk response here and we’ve got to do this in a very considered way,” he said.
An Taoiseach added that himself, Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan met last night to discuss inflation and that they will also be meeting with Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe and Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath in the coming weeks to outline how to help insulate people from inflationary pressures.
“To create a process that will be inclusive that will cover all elements of this. Budgetary policy right through to how we respond to the immediate pressures. That’s how we see it right now,” Martin said.
Varadkar added that the Carbon Tax increase was “legislated for” and is contained in the Programme for Government but that the government understands that “even a small increase has an impact on household budgets”.
“So what we’re examining at the moment, working across government, is to see whether there are ways that we can offset that increase so that people aren’t any worse off in the round around as a result,” Varadkar said.
He added: “There are lots of reasons why you’re seeing the cost of living rise, and that’s to do with monetary policy, it’s to do with the pandemic and supply chains  and it is to do with the war in Ukraine as well. And while we do need to respond to the symptoms, which is price rises, that’s not the solution.”
The Taoiseach was also questioned during Leaders’ Questions today whereby Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the cost of living is a big issue for the public.
She said there is no sense of urgency or agility in dealing with the crisis, adding that the carbon tax hike is coming at the wrong time.
“Your position is wrong and you need to listen. People can’t afford a carbon tax increase, they don’t have the money to give,” she said.
Related ReadsIrish grocery prices have increased at their fastest pace this year in nearly a decadeTaoiseach: 'Carbon Tax not as significant as political debate would suggest'Protests to take place across Britain over cost-of-living crisis
The Taoiseach accused Sinn Féin of “double speak” when it comes to climate action.
Martin and Varadkar are expected to come under pressure at their respective Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings tomorrow on Carbon Tax and cost-of-living concerns.
Asked about this, Varadkar said his party may have policies that are “different to what’s in the Programme for Government” but that the programme was endorsed by the membership.
Echoing Martin’s comments from yesterday that the government “can’t take measures every single week”, Varadkar also said the government “can’t come back every few weeks with a new measure to offset a particular price increase”.
“We need to see this for what it is, which is an international crisis, an increase in inflation that’s going to be with us for years, more so than months. And then we need to respond to it in the end,” he said.

Mr Martin rejected a joint call from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) and the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine for Government action to curb the spread of the virus in hospitals to help staff exhausted from dealing with multiple waves of the disease.
He said the public health view was that the BA.2 Omicron variant, while not as virulent as past strains, was so transmissible it was “almost impossible” to stop transmission.
The two groups representing hospital workers called for mask-wearing indoors and working from home to be reintroduced.
Dublin City University professor of immunology Christine Loscher said Mr Martin's remarks that mandatory mask-wearing would not change the trajectory of the Covid-19 wave sent ""a really bad message to the public that there is nothing that they can do to stop what's happening"".
His comments were “very surprising”, she said, when the Government had advised on mask-wearing earlier in the pandemic to slow transmission and prevent the hospital system being overwhelmed.
“The public need to get a very clear message that there are things that we can do to reduce transmission and our risk of Covid-19; they are all the things we have done before,” she said.
The INMO said last month was the worst March for overcrowding since the union began counting patients on trolleys 16 years ago.
More than 11,000 patients have been without a hospital bed during the month of March with University Hospital Limerick being the most overcrowded with 1,671 patients on trolleys followed by University Hospital Galway with 947 patients.
A further 11,741 Covid-19 infections were reported yesterday, while there were 1,535 people in hospital with the disease, down 75 on the previous day.

The Taoiseach has called on the secondment of Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan to Trinity College to be paused pending a reassessment.
The Government is due to receive a report on the process around the appointment next week.
Speaking in Helsinki this morning Taoiseach Micheál Martin put a pause on Dr Tony Holohan’s appointment to a Professorship at Trinity College.
He said there is merit to establishing the new role – but there absolutely has to be full transparency about how it was done.
Micheál Martin has requested a full report from the Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, who has asked head of the Department Robert Watt to report back in a few days.
There is notable anger at Cabinet about the move, which would see Dr Holohan paid his existing salary by the State despite taking up a new job.
The fact this role was created, at the expense of the State, without the knowledge of Ministers, is something the politicians are deeply unhappy about.

Attending the Fianna Fáil 1916 commemoration at Arbour Hill on Sunday, Mr Martin was asked by The Irish Times if Irish neutrality needs to change in response to the invasion of Ukraine. He said: “I do think it needs to evolve, yes. It has evolved to a large extent.”
Mr Martin said not being part of military alliance was a characteristic of Irish neutrality in the past, but given the threat from Russia and the changing nature of the threat, Ireland should work with other countries to ensure its security.
He said that Ireland already co-operated on security with other EU countries. Asked if that was not being part of an alliance he said: “It’s not yet, there’s no formal EU pact, and if there was there would have to be a referendum for us to join such a pact.
“I do think we have to evolve our thinking on this.”
In his speech, Mr Martin said: “We have to be clear that we need a proper, informed and inclusive debate about our future policies.”
He added: “The world has changed and Ireland must respond. We cannot sit still and simply hope that we are left alone.”
In a reference to Russian military exercises that have taken place near Ireland, Mr Martin said: “In the sea and air around our island we have seen actions taken which have no innocent explanation. Óglaigh na hÉireann must have the capacity and the authority to carry out essential functions to protect our freedoms and those who share our values.”
Mr Martin also referenced efforts to increase defence and security spending and co-operation in the EU: “Our commitment to working with our European partners has to be reinforced. Co-ordination and shared activities with other defence forces over the last 20 years has proven that this activity is a benefit to us and aids European security. We have to look for ways to build on this.”
Mr Higgins, who last week called for a “well-informed debate” on Irish neutrality, told a gathering in Howth Co Dublin on Saturday: “I think there is a special role for people and countries who embrace neutrality to be active in making the case for diplomacy to the very end.”
He said that the “rise of the bellicose language of militarism must end”.
Mr Higgins was speaking at the unveiling of the restored “Éire 6” sign – designed to inform aircraft they were in Irish airspace during the second World War, which he said proclaimed Irish neutrality in the war.
Referring to the war in Ukraine, Mr Higgins paid tribute to “the brave Ukrainian people who are struggling to defend their homes and their people”.
“A great sense of darkness has fallen across the world with the unfolding tragedy in Ukraine,” he said. The darkness had “resulted from the invasion by its [Ukraine’s] powerful neighbour [Russia] operating with total disregard for the principles of international law”.
The President said that “we must always exert all of our efforts to avoid war and armed conflict and we must relentlessly pursue a diplomatic approach and particularly involving the multilateral institutions, if we are to avoid bloodshed”.

David Minogue's apology came after Taoiseach Micheál Martinsaid he was ""concerned"" over the council's alleged attemptto link advertising spend with the broadcaster to editorial content.
Mr Martin commented after details of an email from March 25th between the broadcaster and the council werepublished in The Irish Times over the weekend.
The email had suggested that the Wexford radio station agree its presenters would not express personal opinions on air in return for the council taking out advertising on the station.
The Taoiseach pointed out that Ireland is a “free society” with a “free media” and that they are entitled to secure advertising in the market “like everybody else”.
Mr Minogue said in a statement issued on Tuesday night that it is “unfortunate” and “regrettable” that an email intended to “create opportunity for an improved working relationship and to avoid future discord can be misinterpreted so as to have the directly opposite effect”.
Mr Mingoue, who is also the council’s head of communications, said: “I wish to apologise to the Elected Members and to my colleagues at Wexford County Council for the manner in which my well-intentioned efforts to rebuild a strong working relationship between the Council and South East Radio have given rise to public controversy.
“It would appear this is exactly what has happened in relation to my email of 25thMarch 2022 to South East Radio.
“My email and its contents were designed to improve the working relationship between Wexford County Council and South East Radio, not to damage it further as I appear inadvertently to have done.”
He said the sides could iron out any differences and that he was “confident” that an “amicable and mutually acceptable outcome” could be achieved.
Mr Minogue said he intends to make contact with Eamon Buttle, general manager of South East Radio, to clarify the matters outlined in his email last month and to “reaffirm” his genuine intentions behind the email.
In January the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) found against council chief executive Tom Enright saying he “misused the council position in effect throwing around the weight of the councils purse” and in doing so put pressure on South East Radio to alter its broadcasting practices.
Mr Enright apologised to the elected members of the council in January for any “embarrassment that he may have caused”.

,FF politicians see Martin becoming tánaiste rather than stepping down as leader,There is overwhelming consensus among Fianna Fáil TDs and Senators that Taoiseach Micheál Martin will move to the tánaiste’s office in December rather than step down as party leader.

The view represents a dramatic turnaround in the standing of Mr Martin among his colleagues. Twelve months ago most Fianna Fáil parliamentarians were of the opinion that he would have no choice but to resign this year ahead of Fine Gael taking over the position of taoiseach.
The Irish Times spoke to 20 of the party’s TDs and Senators on Monday to seek their response to the latest The Irish Times/Ipsos poll, which last week showed a rise of three percentage points in the party’s support and also found Mr Martin to be the State’s most popular party leader.
All of those who spoke to The Irish Times stated that they did not see any change in the party leadership occurring this year or early next year.
However, their views were divided on whether or not Mr Martin would lead Fianna Fáil into the next general election, due to take place in 2025. More of his colleagues said it was likely the party would have a new leader at that stage, but sentiment among those contacted was less decisive on a leadership change than they were previously.
Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien, Senator Timmy Dooley and Minister of State Robert Troy all stated categorically that Mr Martin would remain as party leader for the foreseeable future.
“In my opinion he will be tánaiste in December and the timing of his departure as leader should be set by him,” said Mr Troy.
Mr Dooley said he believed Mr Martin would lead the party into the next elections. “I think his personal rating is strong and will help us closer to the elections.”
Several pointed to a parliamentary party meeting in Cavan last autumn as a turning point as well as the return of “in-person” meetings as Covid-19 restrictions eased, which diffused some of the internal tension that emerged during the pandemic. Others pointed to Mr Martin growing into the role.
Senator Malcolm Byrne said: “He has shown real leadership on Covid and on Ukraine. He is not afraid of the tough and long-term decisions and won’t go down the populist route.”
Most believe Mr Martin will be replaced before the next election. “He cannot lead us into the next general election even if he’s God,” said one backbencher.
Another TD said: “I think he intends to lead us into the election, whether he will or not. I get a bit uneasy if he goes back as tánaiste and we have a couple of bad polls.”
A TD based in the east said: “He’s in his 12th year as leader now. He will be tánaiste but there needs to be an orderly transition before the election.”
Another said: “I personally don’t believe he’ll lead us into the next election. I’d hope there won’t be any acrimony when changing leadership.”
A TD from the south said the recent poll findings had greatly increased the chances of Mr Martin staying on as leader.
Another said: “Things can change quickly in politics. A year ago I think the expectation was that he would step down at the time of the transition, but I wouldn’t bet against him leading into the next election.”
A parliamentarian based in the east said: “His poll numbers are good but again Mary Harney was the most popular leader and the Progressive Democrats were only on 5 per cent. So it’s delivery, delivery, delivery. At this point I don’t see him going anywhere yet, and I don’t yet see a strong line-up ready to replace him. Again, that’s yet.”

Speaking before an event on the shared island organised by the think tank TASC on Thursday evening, Micheál Martin said he had spoken with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys on the matter.
He said providing payments was not a “money issue”, adding: “I spoke this morning to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Protection in particular, to look at various options,” he said.
“There are issues that would have to be sorted out, but in the first instance, what needs to happen is those who have pledged (accommodation) we need to get through that process, perhaps more quickly - it’s more time consuming on all involved,” he said.
Asked if the Government would consider capping the number of arrivals, he said “we’re not looking at that right now, but it’s going to be very challenging, and we’ll see how this pans out.” Asked if he would rule out putting a cap on arrivals, he then said that was not under consideration “at all”.
“We’re looking at looking after people as they come into the country. But it means new options and different options, given that we’ve exhausted a lot of facilities already, but we’re consistently working at expanding our capacities.”
He said Russian president Vladimir Putin sees migration as a ""weapon"" to create pressure on European countries.
""That explains the levelling of residential areas in Ukraine which had no military installations, (in a) very targeted, horrible strategy,"" he said.
The Taoiseach said Putin had created an energy crisis and is “creating potentially a famine crisis” with attacks on grain silos and curtailing the export of Ukrainian grain, which he said will create issues “downstream”.
He said the Government is examining what can be constructed to accommodate refugees, but also what buildings could be reconfigured to make them suitable for refugees - and that this issue was being examined by a group of former local authority public servants working under the aegis of Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien.

,"Two local authorities did not build any social homes last year, expert says","Two local authorities, including Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien’s own Fingal County Council and Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s Cork City Council, built no social homes last year despite having big social housing waiting lists, according to housing expert Lorcan Sirr.

At a housing webinar event hosted by homeless charity Simon yesterday, Dr Sirr produced social housing output figures for 2021, which he and Dublin architect Mel Reynolds had obtained from the Department of Housing.
They show Fingal and Cork City – in terms of direct delivery – built no social homes in 2021, while South Dublin City Council built just two. Fingal, however, acquired 406 new units from approved housing bodies (AHBs), while Cork City and South Dublin acquired 41 and 244 from AHBs.
The figures show “actual new builds” by the four Dublin local authorities last year came to just 175, the lowest level in five years. When AHB builds and turnkeys, those bought from private developers, are added, the four authorities delivered 1,075 additional social units in 2021. The four authorities had a combined social housing waiting list of 25,597 in 2021.
Dr Sirr, a lecturer in housing studies at Technological University Dublin, said the very low level of direct builds by councils explained why waiting lists were so high. He also noted that local authorities were sitting on large tracts of public land, which were ripe for development.
“It’s never clear if it’s a lack of will on the councils’ behalf or if obstacles are in their way via the processes they have to go through with the Department of Housing,” he said.
Councils have long complained that the red tape involved in direct delivery made the purchase of turnkey properties from the private sector more achievable.
Dr Sirr also spoke about the State’s housing output more generally and about the number of new homes that are actually sold on the open market.
He said of the 20,433 new homes built last year just 5,698 (28 per cent) made it on to the open market when those purchased by the State, those acquired by build-to-rent investment funds and single, one-off dwellings are removed. This compares with just over 7,000 in 2020.
“So as output [over the last five years] has gone up by close to 50 per cent, the amount of housing coming to the market has gone down by the same amount,” he said.
“This is the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about. The availability of stock for ordinary people on ordinary wages looking for a house to buy has plummeted,” Dr Sirr said.
He was speaking as Central Statistics Office figures showed housing output jumped to its highest level in a decade but that much of the new stock was apartments destined for the rental market.
Separate figures from the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland pointed to continued growth in mortgage activity, with approvals and drawdowns increasing March. A total of 9,910 new mortgages to the value of €2.5 billion were drawn down by borrowers during the first quarter of 2022, 9 per cent up in volume terms on the same period last year.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin is to deliver the opening address at a four-day conference on the Irish Civil War at University College Cork when over 130 experts will gather to reflect on the conflict which began 100 years ago this June.
The Irish Civil War National Conference will be held from June 15th to June 18th on the UCC campus and will explore the political, social, cultural, military, and economic dimensions to the Irish Civil War.
Mr Martin, who has an MA in Irish History, has written about the revolutionary period in his native Cork in his book ""Freedom to Choose: Cork and Party Politics in Ireland 1918-1932' published by Collins Press in 2009.
UCC President, Prof John O’Halloran explained that the event at which the Taoiseach will speak is part of the Irish government’s Decade of Centenaries Programme and will be open to the public and recorded for viewing in collaboration with RTE.ie.
“This major conference marks a new chapter in the Decade of Centenaries, as our reflections move on from Ireland’s hard-fought independence to a new contemplation of an internal struggle that divided families and friends.”
It was fitting UCC should host the conference as academics and researchers from its School of History had excelled throughout the analysis of the Decade of Centenaries by leading debate, provoking thought, and challenging consensus, he said.
Dr Mervyn O’Driscoll, Head of the School of History at UCC, said that the university was committed to making its historical scholarship accessible to the broader community and pointed out that the conference was free.
The event is intended “to bring Irish Civil War history to a broad audience in order to help better inform the debates which are sure to emerge throughout this final stage of the Decade of Centenaries,” he said.
Dr O’Driscoll said the intention is that the conference will bring together on-going academic research into the conflict.
The aim is try to accomplish what the government's Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations described as, 'meaningful engagements with a difficult and traumatic time', he added.
During the first three days of the conference after Mr Martin’s opening lecture, national and international speakers will deliver 20-minute papers addressing all aspects of the conflict including international comparisons and global contexts.
The panel of experts will also look at the Irish Civil War in terms of military conflict, civilian trauma, gender roles, labour militancy, state violence, agrarian unrest, military strategy, propaganda, memory, ideology and prison experiences.
Other speakers will speak about the use of the Miltary Archives and plenary lectures will be delivered by Prof Anne Dolan (TCD), Prof Robert Gerwarth (UCD), Prof Helen Graham (University of London), Dr Bill Kissane (London School of Economics).
Dr Lindsey Earner-Byrne, Senior Academic Leadership Initiative Chair in Irish Gender History at UCC said that staff at UCC were very excited to host a conference that would showcase the most cutting-edge research on the Irish Civil War.
“We are particularly excited to front previously overlooked or under-researched aspects such as trauma, sexual and gender-based violence and the archaeology and material culture of the Civil War.”
The conference will close with a day of 'plenary panels', as experts explore the topics of Trauma, Partition, Faith, Gender, Diplomacy, Politics, Labour, Disorder, Literature, and Memory.

Shawn Pogatchnik,Irish premier: UK breaking ‘spirit’ of Northern Ireland peace deal,Micheál Martin says London's unilateral approach ignores what made the 1998 breakthrough possible.,https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-premier-micheal-martin-uk-breaking-spirit-northern-ireland-peace-deal/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,europeanvoice,general,en,us,2022-05-20T11:38:59+00:00,"Micheál Martin says London’s unilateral approach ignores what made the 1998 breakthrough possible.
BELFAST — The British government is breaking the spirit of the Good Friday agreement and needlessly risking the future of Northern Ireland power-sharing as it confronts Europe over the post-Brexit trade protocol, Irish Prime MinisterMicheál Martin said Friday at the start of a day of diplomacy in Belfast.
“It’s not good enough that the institutions of the Good Friday agreement should be at risk on this issue,” Martin said before entering talks with Democratic Unionist Party leader Jeffrey Donaldson at a central Belfast hotel.
The DUP, now insecond place behind Sinn Féinfollowing this month’s Stormont elections, is using its position as the main British unionist party toblock operationof the Northern Ireland Assembly and formation of a new cross-community government, a central objective of the region’s 1998 peace accord.
Donaldson said his party would keepwielding its vetoon progress until Britain unilaterally halts EU-required checks on British goods arriving at Northern Irish ports, a step that Foreign Secretary LizTruss saysBritain soon could take.
When asked whether the DUP would ever agree to compromise on the protocol’s requirement for at least some enforcement of a so-calledIrish Sea borderbetween Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K., Martin said the main problem lies in London.
“My main concern is, will the United Kingdom government ever be satisfied? Even though it signed off on this deal, ratified it in parliament [and] now says they want to unravel it,” Martin told BBC Radio Ulster.
Martin — who was part of the Irish government that signed the peace agreement alongside Tony Blair’s Labour government on Good Friday 24 years ago — said Boris Johnson’s administration appeared disinterested in maintaining the kind of close London-Dublin cooperation that runs through the Good Friday deal.
He said his government and the European Commission both had hoped the U.K. would pursue “professional, serious negotiations” with Brussels once the May 5 assembly elections were out of the way. Instead, he said, they now faced “unilateralism on behalf of a British government saying, ‘our way or no way.’ You don’t negotiate with the European Union on that basis.”
Martin said previous British governments had worked “hand in glove” with Dublin to keep “anchoring the peace” in Belfast.
But this British government, he said, increasingly acts on its own and has unsettled the delicate balance of interests painstakingly achieved in 1998.
“The current U.K. government has moved too far in a unilateral way on issues, be itlegacy issues, be itthe protocol. In my view that is not fully in accordance with the spirit of the Good Friday agreement,” he said, describing that spirit as “collaboration and working together.”
Martin accused Johnson and Truss of unreasonably dismissing the European Commission'sOctober proposalsfor reforming protocol rules. The EU “really didn’t get any response,” he said, while EU lead negotiator Maroš Šefčovič “got nowhere” in identifying any clearly defined “landing zone” from the British.
Instead, he said, London kept pocketing EU offers — particularly on the free movement of British-made generic drugs to Northern Ireland, a part of the October package that the EU hasalready enactedon its own — and raising new demands.
“What really worries me is this degree to which the goal posts keep on shifting, that one can never say that if we resolve this particular issue or that issue, that we will get a resolution once and for all,” he said.
Martinspoke Thursdayto Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about the impasse, and said she fully shared his concerns. “There’s a lot of frustration on the EU side,” he said.

European countries have accused Russia of employing a range of so-called hybrid war techniques including disinformation and cyberattacks in arenas far beyond Ukraine.
Asked after a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels about the potential risks to Ireland from hybrid threats, Mr Martin said precautions were being taken.
“We will work with our European colleagues in respect of some of those hybrid threats, and particularly around cybersecurity. We had a bad experience last year in respect of a cyber security attack on our health service,” Mr Martin said.
“We’re taking all precautionary measures right now in terms of potential attacks of that kind no matter where they may emanate from.”
The Irish health service was hit by a massive cyberattack last year which caused chaos in hospitals, delayed patient care and led to expected costs of almost €100 million to deal with the fallout.
A malicious file attached to a phishing email opened at a HSE workstation on March 18th led to a shutdown of the HSE's computer systems once the Conti ransomware that was introduced into the HSE's IT system was detonated on May 14th.
The criminal gang behind the attack – believed by several observers to be most likely based in Russia – demanded $20 million (€17.7 million) in Bitcoin in ransom.
The Government said no ransom would be paid and on May 20th the hackers posted a link to a key that decrypted files which had been encrypted by the ransomware.
Mr Martin also acknowledged that there was a risk to the Irish economy from blowback from potential sanctions on Russia that the EU has threatened to impose if it invades Ukraine.
The current Ukraine crisis has further driven up prices of gas, which is supplied to the EU through pipelines running through Ukraine and other countries from Russia, and the Taoiseach said the events illustrated the need to diversify to alternative sources of energy, including renewables.
The supply of the fossil fuel has been used by Moscow in the past as a way to wield political pressure, and supply is expected to tighten if hostilities flare in Ukraine.
""We need to diversify across Europe in terms of dependence on Russian gas and oil,"" Mr Martin said.
“This type of geopolitical crisis that can occur from time to time illustrates the dangers of being so dependent.”

The hybrid model caused grade inflation and put pressure on the third level system, he added.
Regarding Covid-19, he said hospitalisations had remained steady and case numbers were stabilising, albeit at a high level.
Mr Martin said he was optimistic for the first time in months, and further easing of restrictions would be considered by the end of next week with the potential for removing some restrictions by the end of the month.
Mr Martin said the 8pm curfew on hospitality was introduced to reduce socialisation, and he hoped it would be lifted by February.
“We wanted to get mobility down by 20-30 per cent ... we felt correctly we could halt the impact of Omicron.”
He was conscious that hospitality and the arts had been badly hit by the pandemic.
Mr Martin also said this measure was in place to ensure the schools could reopen, and he didn’t expect them to close again.
He also thanked the Irish people for following public health guidance and getting vaccinated.
The booster programme, especially the GPs and pharmacists who “played a blinder” before Christmas, played a role in ensuring the Omicron wave was not as serious as it could have been, according to Mr Martin.
Ireland is currently developing a more long-term vaccination strategy, the Taoiseach added. “I can see the potential of a fourth dose for over 60s and the immunocompromised. We may be looking at an annual vaccination programme.”

“THE PROBLEM IS we’re not building enough houses or apartments. Full stop,” Taoiseach Micheál Martin said today, dismissing concerns raised by the Social Democrats about an investment fund buying a three-bed, end-of-terrace house in Swords for €1.7 million.
The Business Post reported on Sunday that some houses in Castleview, an estate of 250 family homes built in the early 2000s, are being snapped up by funds for well over the asking price.
The newspaper reported that both the €1.7 million and €850,000 homes were purchased from a company, which acquired those properties in 2021 for €345,000 and €360,000 respectively.
Social Democrats co-leader Roísín Shortall said in the Dáil today that such purchases are having “a hugely distorting effect on the market”.
She questioned how first-time buyers or any ordinary buyers interested in purchasing a home in Castleview would be able to compete if funds can pay such a premium for three bed terrace homes?
Long-term leases with the state
The state is fueling such sales of family homes between investors as they are entering into long-term lease agreements with the Government, that will see these investments “enormous as they are, repaid over 25 years”, she said.
She called on the Taoiseach to apologise to the public for “misleading this house when you said investment funds should not compete for homes with first-time buyers”.
Micheál Martin took issue with her assertions, stating that parties are “distorting” the narrative when it comes to discussing problems in housing. He said investors were being made out to be big players in the housing market, when he claimed they are not.
Advertisement
He said the state itself is building homes, and through approved social housing bodies, are providing thousands of social and affordable homes.
Martin said the overall proportion of the number of houses that are bought in 2021 by non-household entities was 11,600 units or 20% of the total units purchased, he said.
Non-household entities includes the state, he clarified.
“When I say ‘non-household’, that 20% includes the state. It includes approved housing bodies and private companies. The state accounts for the largest single share of purchases within the non-household category, about 32% of purchases” of the non-household.
First-time buyers
First-time buyers accounted for 26% of all properties purchased in 2021, said the Taoiseach, adding that more first-time buyers bought their first home in the last 12 months than in any year since 2008.
“The state purchases are largely concentrated on houses – 66% of state purchases have been houses,” he told the Dáil.
Speaking about the case in the Business Post, the Taoiseach said: “My understanding is that fund bought from a fund. We’re not competing with first-time buyers in that case… the point being that were units already assigned to social housing, with leases of 25 years, at the time of the sale, these properties are required to remain in social housing for the entirety of their lease, therefore any subsequent sale those properties would not be in competition with purchasers.”
The Taoiseach said the debate about housing is being distorted as if the only players are institutional investors, adding “they are not, they are minority players in the overall scheme of things in terms of construction”.
“The state is the biggest actor,” he added.
He reiterated that supply is the answer in his view, stating that 35,000 to 40,000 houses need to be built each year with the state population going over 5 million and with 70,000 people coming into the country in the last year.

LABOUR PARTY LEADER Ivana Bacik has called for the Taoiseach to issue a State apology and a compensation package for thalidomide survivors in Ireland.
Thalidomide was a drug originally used as a sedative for pregnant women in the 1950s and 1960s and left their children with severe physical disabilities.
At Leaders’ Questions this afternoon, Bacik said that the Irish State bares responsibility for the continued use of the drug after it was pulled from use in other European countries and called for a State apology, a compensation package and a healthcare package for survivors.
“In this state, even after international withdrawal, the drug continued to be prescribed for some time, causing severe harm to so many children,” Bacik told the Dáil.

While Bacik did acknowledge that a compensation package had been offered in 2009, she said that this did “not come near enough to meet the real cost of the harm caused”.
In response, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that he wanted to develop a “mediation approach” with the thalidomide survivors and said that he would be in touch with them in the next two weeks.
He said that he wanted to have the issue resolved “as quickly as we can”, but that there were potential issues around payments.
Martin said that he wanted to ensure that any payments made to thalidomide survivors from the Irish State were not subtracted from the payments currently made by the thalidomide foundation, saying that there was “legal clarity” being sought on the issue.
Bacik said that she would be bringing forward a motion to call on the Government to offer a “decent package” to thalidomide survivors, saying that she hoped to receive cross-party support.

It follows another month of record homelessness figures in the Republic of Ireland with over 10,800 people accessing emergency accommodation as of the latest figures.
Despite that Micheál Martin says they don’t plan to bring back an eviction ban because of constitutional concerns – that’s despite a similar ban being put in during the Covid pandemic lockdowns…

BreakingNews.ie,Taoiseach among world leaders to pay tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Mr Gorbachev was one of very few leaders who ""can be said to have truly changed the world""",https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/tributes-paid-to-courage-and-integrity-of-mikhail-gorbachev-1357375.html,breakingnews,general,en,ie,2022-08-31T05:31:43+00:00,"Luke O'Reilly, PA
Taoiseach Micheál Martin and British prime minister Boris Johnson are among those who have paid tribute to former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Mr Gorbachev’s death at the age of 91 has inspired an outpouring of tributes from leaders around the world.
Many made reference to the timing of his death during the worst period of relations between Russia and the West since the end of the Cold War.

In a statement issued on Tuesday night, Mr Martin said he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Mr Gorbachev's death, describing him as ""one of the most significant political figures of the late 20th Century"".
""At a time when the threat to the world of nuclear destruction was very real, he saw the urgent need for rapprochement with the west and for greater openness and reform - glasnost and perestroika - in the then Soviet Union.
""His leadership helped to end the arms race between the east and west, end the Cold War and bring down the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since the Second World War.
""That contributed directly to the enlargement of the European Union that came to fruition during Ireland’s 2004 Presidency of the EU,"" the Taoiseach said.
Mr Martin added: ""There are very few figures who can be said to have truly changed the world. Mikhail Gorbachev was one. He will long be remembered.""
I'm saddened to hear of the death of Gorbachev.I always admired the courage & integrity he showed in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful conclusion.In a time of Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, his tireless commitment to opening up Soviet society remains an example to us all.
— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson)August 30, 2022

Meanwhile, in a Twitter post, Mr Johnson said he was “saddened” to hear of Mr Gorbachev’s death, at a “time of Putin’s aggression in Ukraine”.
“I’m saddened to hear of the death of Gorbachev,” the British prime minister said.
“I always admired the courage and integrity he showed in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful conclusion.


“In a time of Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, his tireless commitment to opening up Soviet society remains an example to us all.”


President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen also responded to the news, saying Mr Gorbachev's leadership ""opened the way for a free Europe"".
“This legacy is one we will not forget. RIP Mikhail Gorbachev,” she added.
Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger said Mr Gorbachev “performed great services” but was “not able to implement all of his visions”, telling BBC’s Newsnight: “The people of eastern Europe and the German people, and in the end the Russian people, owe him a great debt of gratitude for the inspiration, for the courage in coming forward with these ideas of freedom.”
Mr Kissinger, after again acknowledging Mr Gorbachev was unable able to implement his full vision, added: “He will still be remembered in history as a man who started historic transformations that were to the benefit of mankind and to the Russian people.”

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said a new Co Offaly facility which will assist the stability and reliability of the electricity grid has come at a “critical time”.
The new €130 million project in Shannonbridge will involve around 150 jobs over its two year construction phase, and support 15 jobs on completion.
When completed, the ‘Shannonbridge B’ grid stability plant will provide an additional 170MWh of hybrid capacity to the national electricity grid.

The new hybrid facility, developed by Irish company Lumcloon Energy and Korea’s Hanwha Energy, is described as a “world’s first” that will more efficiently meet the changing needs of the power system as the level of renewable energies increases.
It combines a long duration battery with a synchronous condenser – the batteries can deliver rapid frequency response, while synchronous condensers provide low carbon inertia, both of which are required to react to any sudden loss in electricity supply or surge in demand.
Turning the first sod on the project, An Taoiseach Micheál Martin labelled it a “high innovative project” that “exemplifies the type of infrastructure we need” given the “impacts of climate change” and “Russia’s immoral war on Ukraine”.
He added that climate change and the war in Ukraine “have demonstrated the need to make urgent progress on the move away from fossil fuels”.
Meanwhile, Nigel Reams, Managing Director of Lumcloon Energy, said the Shannonbridge B project will accelerate the decarbonisation of the Irish energy sector and will facilitate the increasing amount of renewables on the system.

"Harry McGee, Seanín Graham",Taoiseach to visit Northern Ireland on Monday in bid to avert fresh Assembly elections,Micheál Martin will meet leaders of the five main parties to discuss key issues including Northern Ireland protocol,https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/10/17/taoiseach-to-visit-northern-ireland-on-monday-in-bid-to-avert-fresh-assembly-elections/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-10-16T23:01:00+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin will travel to Belfast on Monday to hold meetings with each of the leaders of the five main parties in Northern Ireland in an effort to restore the Northern institutions and prevent mandatory elections at the end of October.
The Taoiseach will meet separately with Michelle O’Neill (Sinn Féin), Jeffrey Donaldson (DUP), Naomi Long (Alliance), Colum Eastwood (SDLP) and Doug Beattie (UUP).
According to Government sources, Mr Martin will urge all parties to renew their efforts to get the Northern Ireland Executive and the all-party Assembly up and running. The deadline is fast approaching for new elections to be called if no resolution is found for the current impasse.
The institutions have been in abeyance since the Assembly elections earlier this year when Sinn Féin became the largest party in Northern Ireland and Ms O’Neill was nominated by her party as the first minister designate.
However, The Democratic Unionist Party has refused to nominate a deputy first minister and has also blocked the appointment of a speaker to the Assembly, which has left it unable to function
Mr Donaldson, the party’s leader, has repeatedly said it will not agree to participate in either the Executive or the Assembly until the Northern Ireland protocol is scrapped or is fundamentally altered.
Mr Martin will also discuss issues around unionist concerns over the protocol during his discussions with all party leaders.
In advance of the Taoiseach’s visit, Mr Donaldson said the debris of the Northern Ireland protocol must be “cleared away” if Stormont powersharing is to return.
Relations between the UK and EU appear to have improved since Liz Truss became prime minister, and London and Brussels have been talking up the potential for a deal through fresh negotiations.
Current legislation says that unless Stormont is restored by October 28th, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has to call Assembly elections — something he has said he is prepared to do.
Mr Donaldson said: “We must lay solid foundations if we are to move forward. We need to clear away the debris of the protocol years. We need to restore cross-community consensus.”

"Cormac McQuinn, Robert Kindregan","‘No appetite’ to cut tax-free inheritance limit, Taoiseach says","Budget focus will be helping families with children with the cost-of-living crisis, Micheál Martin says",https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2022/09/12/no-appetite-to-cut-tax-free-inheritance-tax-limit-taoiseach-says/,irishtimes,general,en,us,2022-09-12T13:59:04+00:00,"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he does not believe there is an appetite to reduce the threshold for the amount of money people can leave to their children tax-free.
He said people pay tax throughout their lives and there an issue with the fairness of the proposal.
Mr Martin poured cold water on the idea as he spoke to reporters ahead of the Fianna Fáil pre-Dáil think-in meeting in Mullingar.
The issue of inheritance tax arises in a report by the Commission on Taxation and Welfare due to be published later this week.
It is reported to include a proposal that there be a “substantial” reduction in the tax-free threshold for the sums parents can leave to their children.
Currently under Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT) rules children can inherit €335,000 tax-free.
The Irish Independent reported the commission has suggested the threshold should be lowered over time to be closer to the sums other family members can leave tax free - €32,5000 in the case of other close family members and €16,250 for distant relatives or friends.
Mr Martin suggested there is little desire in the Government to reduce the threshold in relation to parents leaving money or property to children.
He said: “Many, many families and family homes I think would be disadvantaged by that.
“We’re talking after all about people who have bought family homes with after-tax income.”
Mr Martin said people pay taxes throughout their lives in what he called a progressive taxation system where the top 20 per cent of earners pay up to 80 per cent of income tax.
“So I think that proposal to say to people - ‘you’ve worked hard on your life, you’ve bought your house... but now actually we want to take more off you when you die and you can’t give it to your family members’ - I think there’s an issue with that in terms of fairness.
“So I don’t detect an appetite for that specific measure.”
Mr Martin said he has not seen the report in full. “We have to look at the Commission of Taxation’s proposals in the entirety.
“But it will fall to Government to consider the report and to make decisions on it but I don’t see an appetite for that.”
On the upcoming Budget, Mr Martin indicated that a focus will be helping families with children with the cost-of-living crisis.
He said energy price increases are impacting on people’s livelihoods, household disposable incomes and they threaten business and jobs.
“Once again Government will have to intervene to protect people first of all in terms of their basic incomes and also to make sure that we protect jobs through this particular crisis.”
He said the budget and an accompanying cost-of-living package will “bring in measures to alleviate the pressures on people insofar as we can”.
He said the three party leaders will meet later this week along with Minister for Finance Paschal Dohonoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath to go through the detail of packages “to help people get through this this very, very difficult and challenging crisis.”
He also said: “We’re looking at families and children in particular because obviously the costs will be higher there for families and obviously child-related costs.”
Mr Martin said the Government want to “allocate as much as we possibly can” for measures that kick-in before the end of 2022 as well as those in the wider budget like providing a “sustained improvement in childcare”.
He said the last budget saw substantial related to childcare workers and the next phase is to improve affordability for parents.
Mr Martin said an element of the cost-of-living package will help families with children “because the costs clearly with children are particularly high.”
Mr McGrath will address his Fianna Fáil colleagues on Budget preparations and the cost-of-living package during a session of the party’s think-in on Tuesday morning.
Meanwhile, the Taoiseach said that housing will continue to be his party’s priority.
“It [housing] is the big social issue of our day which will be a constant for quite some time. Not withstanding cost of living issues, not withstanding the war in Ukraine and other major issues that have happened.
“From a societal point of view, we know we have to keep the focus on housing, to get more houses built. This will need a society wide response, to work together and remove obstacles to development.
“We are seeing good progress overall in terms of the housing issue, but I am impatient for much much more.”
Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien confirmed that there has been significant progress made in terms of housing development so far in 2022. He said that the Government may even exceed this year’s targets.
“Housing is our number one priority, and it is good to see real momentum being built right across the country in delivering more social homes this year than we have done in any year of the state.
“We intend to achieve and potentially overachieve on our target this year of 24,600 new homes but we do need to do a lot more. There are challenges there, but we will overcome them.”

POLITICAL LEADERS FROM both sides of the border have gathered in Belfast this afternoon at a memorial service for Queen Elizabeth II.
The service was attended by King Charles III and the Queen Consort as part of their tour of Northern Ireland today.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin, President Michael D Higgins, Sabina Higgins and Northern Ireland’s First Minister designate Michelle O’Neill were among those in attendance at the ceremony alongside new UK Prime Minister Liz Truss.

President Higgins also shook hands with the new king following the ceremony.
Ahead of the service, the king met with political leaders from Northern Ireland at Hillsborough Castle, including O’Neill, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long.
O’Neill told the king that she was sorry for his loss during their meeting.
“Her life and legacy will be fondly remembered by those of a British identity here who with great pride and devotion held her very dear,” said O’Neill.
“She led by example in advancing peace and reconciliation and the building of relationships with those of us who are Irish, and who share a different political allegiance and aspirations to herself and her Government.
“I hope this continues now that you are King and the British-Irish relationship strengthens and evolves as one era ends, and a new one begins in these changing times.”
Meanwhile, the king questioned Donaldson over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has lead to political deadlock with no Assembly or Executive in place.
Donaldson told the king that there had been positive sounds coming from the EU on the protocol and that he was hopeful that matters would “progress”.

MARC MACSHARRY’S READMITTANCE to the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party has hit a stumbling block this evening, with party whip Jack Chambers and the Taoiseach telling members that “an issue has arisen” in bringing him back into the fold.
It had been widely expected that Chambers would put down a motion this evening proposing MacSharry return to the party.
It is understood that there has been no accusation of wrongdoing on the part of McSharry. It is believed the issue raised is a matter pertaining to internal party politics.
Fianna Fáil sources have toldThe Journalthat members were told there was an issue, with the Taoiseach asking TDs and senators to “trust the whip to deal with it”.
No further details were given to TDs about what the hold-up is but a number of TDs, including Barry Cowen and John McGuinness, spoke up and were highly critical of the Taoiseach in the manner in which he handled matters this evening.
One TD said it was “wrong” to deal with an internal party matter in this way, stating that the discussion was shut down before the Taoiseach had to leave the meeting early as he is travelling to Brussels this evening.

Another TD said: “I think it was badly handled by the boss” tonight. Another said it has only bolstered those who want Martin gone as party leader, indicating it was a “starting gun” for a leadership heave.
Inrecent weeksthere have been calls for MacSharry to make a return.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin had a heated discussion with MacSharry last week over the process of how the TD could be readmitted to the party.
MacSharry is understood to have raised several other incidents in which Fianna Fáil TDs resigned the party whip and returned without having to reapply.
MacSharry resigned the Fianna Fáil whip last yearfollowing the Katherine Zappone controversy that erupted around Foreign Minister Simon Coveney.
The controversy, which stemmed from the appointment of Zappone as a UN Special Envoy, lead to a vote of no-confidence in the Foreign Affairs Minister.
In his resignation letter, MacSharry hit out at the Taoiseach and his leadership of the party, which is understood to have been an issue of discussion between the pair last week, with Martin taking issue with the comments.
MacSharry had said that Fianna Fáil party positioning and policy were being determined “in a fashion consistent with an undemocratic totalitarian regime”.

LAST UPDATE|7 Jul 2022
SINN FÉIN IS considering tabling a motion of no confidence in the government, following its loss of a Dáil majority.
The party’s president Mary Lou McDonald told reporters today that a decision would be made tomorrow on whether to submit the motion.
McDonald said: “We’ve had two years now of what I would describe as disastrous government in the areas of housing, in healthcare. We have moved from fiasco to the next.”
The government lost its Dáil majority last night after Donegal TD Joe McHugh resigned the Fine Gael whip. He had voted against the government’s bill on a mica redress scheme.
“The appetite for change that was evident in the last general election has not gone away … people are running out of patience, if they had any to begin with.”
The deadline to submit such a motion for next week is 11am tomorrow.
McDonald said the only opportunity for change was a general election. She said Sinn Féin “would not make the same mistake again” of running too few candidates.
When asked if she had a message for independent TDs who would support the government, she said: “Yes – please stop.”
When asked this afternoon about the planned no-confidence motion, the Taoiseach said that the Government “welcome the opportunity” to prove it has a working majority.
“We have a good working majority. We welcome the opportunity that will present to us to outline the fact that this has been a competent and good government,” said Micheál Martin.
He said that it was not an unexpected move from Sinn Féin, adding that opposition parties from time to time put down no-confidence motions in the last week of the parliamentary term.
He defended the Government’s record on issues like the response to Covid-19, climate change and housing.

“We have a lot to say in terms of policy: education, health and of course housing, where the Housing for All represents the most comprehensive suite of policies that have been advanced by any political party in the country,” said Martin.
He said that he was “not at all” worried about entering an election with his party and reiterated that he intends to lead Fianna Fáil into the next general election.
Joe McHughRollingNews.ieRollingNews.ie
McHugh told Raidió na Gaeltachta this morning that his priority was the people affected by the mica scandal.
Many of the homes affected by faulty mica blocks are in McHugh’s constituency.
He said he stood over the decision, because he had issues with the proposed redress scheme which could not be addressed before the Dáil rises for the summer recess.
The government has insisted it still has a working majority following McHugh’s resignation of the whip.
Green Party Minister Roderic O’Gorman downplayed the effects of the development this morning, saying he believes the party will still be able to implement its agenda.
Also speaking on RTÉ radio today, O’Gorman, the Minister for Children, pointed out that all votes in the Dáil passed last night, “despite the regrettable loss of Joe McHugh”.
“His concern was with that one piece of legislation.”
McHugh said in May that he would not be contesting the next general election.
O’Gorman said that Neasa Hourigan and Patrick Costello, two Green TDs who are suspended from the party until November, have “indicated that they wish to continue to support the government”.
“So I think we’ll continue to implement the Green Party’s agenda in terms of climate, in terms of transport [and] with the wider government as well in terms of housing and childcare.”

LAST UPDATE|8 Jul 2022
SINN FÉIN WILL table a motion of no-confidence in the Government today.
Sinn Féin’s President Mary Lou McDonald confirmed that the motion would be tabled at 9am this morning, with it set to be held before the Dáil breaks for the summer next week.
The move to table the motion comes after theGovernment lost their majorityon Wednesday, after Fine Gael TD Joe McHugh voted against the Government on mica redress legislation.
McHugh has since resigned the Fine Gael whip, leaving the Government with the confirmed support of just 79 TDs, one short of a majority.
Speaking to Morning Ireland this morning, McDonald said that the Government had “run out of road”.
“This Government has lost its majority. It can certainly cobble together majorities for votes on a one-by-one basis but two years on we believe this Government has run out of road,” McDonald said.
“They’re out of time, they’re out of ideas. We think it is important now that not just Sinn Féin as the leaders of opposition, but the entire opposition, including independent TDs hold them to account, and bring their tenure to an end.”
“I think we’re at a point now that the case for and the need for change in Government is unanswerable.”
Yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin told reporters that the Government welcomes the opportunity to prove it has a working majority.
“We have a good working majority. We welcome the opportunity that will present to us to outline the fact that this has been a competent and good government,” said an Taoiseach.
He said that it was not an unexpected move from Sinn Féin, adding that opposition parties from time to time put down no-confidence motions in the last week of the parliamentary term.
He defended the Government’s record on issues like the response to Covid-19, climate change and housing.
“We have a lot to say in terms of policy: education, health and of course housing, where the Housing for All represents the most comprehensive suite of policies that have been advanced by any political party in the country,” said Martin.
Ministers Darragh O’Brien and Paschal Donohoe told reporters this afternoon that they were looking forward to the motion, with Donohoe criticising Sinn Féin for bringing it forward.

Ministers@DarraghOBrienTDand@Paschaldhave said that they are ""looking forward"" to debating the motion of no-confidence put forward by Sinn Fein this morningpic.twitter.com/iSJBdq1M5F
“Sinn Féin are only interested in creating a culture of instability at a time in which we can see the dangers of instability elsewhere,” said Donohoe.
“I look forward to the opportunity actually next week if that’s what Sinn Féin want to use their time on, on a no-confidence motion is debating that with them and showing what we have done in the area of housing,” said O’Brien.
“Next week actually affords us an opportunity across all the different sectors that we’ve been working on, all the different ministries, to put forward what Government actually has been doing.”
Justice minister Helen McEntee said Sinn Féin was “talking out of both sides of their mouth”.
“They have spent the last week criticising all of us for the fact that there isn’t enough time being given for legislation to pass through, that motions have been put through quickly.
“And yet, we now have a motion that is going to take up hours of Dail time this week in our last week, which is not going to do anything because I have full confidence that government will actually pass this, or will will succeed in in the no confidence motion,” McEntee said.
The Rural Independent Group of TDs announced this afternoon that they will not be supporting the “brain-dead government” which they said is “bereft of ideas or purpose”.
The group’s leader Mattie McGrath said: “The problem with this Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party government is that they think their job is to hold the people accountable to the government rather than the government accountable to the people.”
Independent TD Michael McNamara also said that he would be voting no-confidence in the Government.
McNamara was critical of the Government for bringing forward large volumes of new legislation and not providing enough time for the Dáil to scrutinise that legislation.
“This government is, while going abroad and talking about the importance of democracies, showing a disdain for the legislative process and the democratic process,” McNamara said.
“There’s an abject lack of humility by this Government and also a lack of recognising that the opposition equally have a mandate and the opposition equally have a job to do in scrutinising legislation.”
He added that it was not just the opposition who had raised concerns, and that some Green Party TDs had voiced their concern over rushed legislation.
McHugh was the latest Government TD to lose the whip, following the Green Party’s Patrick Costello and Neasa Hourigan, who voted against the Government over the National Maternity Hospital controversy.

TAOISEACH MICHEAL MARTIN is to visit Japan next week on an official visit, where he will express condolences for the killing of former Prime MinisterShinzo Abe.
Martin will also travel to Singapore on the four-day trip.
It is hoped that the visit will reinforce relations between Ireland and the two countries, and will develop the Irish relationship with the Asia-Pacific region.
In Tokyo, the Taoiseach will meet with political representatives, the business community and members of the Irish diaspora.
He will also meet with Japan’s Prime Minister Kishida, and visit the site of the new Ireland House in Tokyo which is due for completion in 2024.
The House will serve as the focal point of the Irish community in Japan.

He will express “sincere condolences” to Kishida and the people of Japan on Abe’s killing, which has shocked the world.
Abe was shot at close range last week while giving a campaign speech in the city of Nara, days ahead of upper house elections that saw his ruling party strengthen its hold on power.
In Singapore, Martin will meet Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Lawrence Wong. He will also meet with a number of Irish companies operating in Singapore, engage with the Irish community and visit Changi Chapel and Museum.
This is the first visit to Japan by a Taoiseach since 2013 and the first to Singapore since 2004.
Speaking ahead of the visit, the Taoiseach said Ireland has “much in common” with Japan and Singapore.
“While there, I expect to discuss Russia’s immoral and inhumane invasion of Ukraine, the impact of which is being felt all around the world.
“We’ll also discuss global challenges, maintaining economic growth, restoring broken supply chains, and how we can work together on climate change.”

LAST UPDATE|8 Jun 2022
THE TAOISEACH HAS told the European Parliament that Ireland “strongly supports” Ukraine’s application to join the bloc.
Addressing the parliament in Strasbourg today, Micheál Martin said membership of the union has been “transformative” for Ireland, describing it as “an historic enabler of sustained progress”.
Martin said he is “humbled and inspired” by the courage of the people of Ukraine and said he hopes that the European Council sends them a “clear and positive” message when it meets this month.
He said the prospect of membership can be a powerful driver of reform and membership itself is the most powerful tool to ensure peace and security in Europe.
“Ireland’s lived experience – and we are not alone in this – is that EU membership is transformative. It is not only about access to markets and to economic opportunity, though that is, of course, important, it is about what it means for people,” Martin said.
The Fianna Fáil leader said Ireland strongly supports the toughest possible sanctions on Russia. “And we do so understanding that this involves costs for us all,” he noted.
“The conflict is, at its most fundamental, about two utterly incompatible views of the world – autocratic and democratic. The new imperialism of Putin’s regime must not stand,” Martin said.
The Taoiseach added that it’s an honour that more than 34,000 Ukrainians have sought shelter in Ireland since Russia launched its invasion.
Martin said Ireland is ready to assist the EU in responding to the looming threat of food insecurity due to Russia’s aggression.
“As a country with our own experience of famine, we condemn the illegal appropriation of agricultural production in Ukraine which is having a direct impact on global food security and affordability, and is affecting the most vulnerable communities in parts of Africa and the Middle East.

“It is hard to comprehend that hunger itself has been weaponised – Ireland will support the EU in playing its part in an effective and swift international coordination to ensure a comprehensive global food security response,” he said.
Protocol
The Taoiseach also discussed climate change and the ongoing tension between the EU and UK over the Northern Ireland Protocol during his speech.
He said there are solutions to the problems posed by the Protocol but the UK government must engage with “good faith, seriousness, and commitment” to find them.
The issue was also addressed by European Parliament President, Roberta Metsola, as she introduced the Taoiseach.
Metsola said the European Parliament’s support for the Protocol is “unwavering” and it is “fully committed” to preserving peace on the island of Ireland.
‘Humiliate’
Meanwhile, Fine Gael MEP Sean Kelly delivered a blistering attack on the French president Emmanuel Macron when he spoke in the European Parliament this morning.
Macrontold medialast Friday that the EU must try to avoid ‘”humiliating” Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Speaking today, Ireland South MEP Kelly asked: “How would he like if somebody invaded France and we started talking about ‘we mustn’t humiliate the aggressor’? So part of France should be handed over to the aggressor.”
He demanded EU leaders find out what the French President meant by his recent calls for Russia not to be ‘humiliated’ over its invasion of Ukraine.
“I think now is the time, and particularly at the next council meeting, to ask Mr Macron what does he mean by this and why is he saying this when the lives of Ukrainians are being destroyed every single day,” he said.

“Unilateral action to set aside a solemn agreement would be deeply damaging,” he said in a speech to the European Parliament.
“It would mark an historic low point signalling a disregard for essential principles of laws, which are the foundation of international relations. And it would, quite literally, be to the benefit of absolutely no one.”

The Taoiseach thanked the parliament for standing by Ireland as it sought to protect the Good Friday Agreement and an open border with the North throughout the Brexit process.
“No serious consideration was given to the implications for Northern Ireland” and the peace process in the Brexit vote, he said.
“All of us in positions of leadership owe it to them not to treat lightly what was so hard won.”
The government of prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to imminently introduce legislation that would allow it to unilaterally break the treaty it agreed with the European Union to govern Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements.
The Johnson administration has said the step is necessary to ensure seamless flow of goods from Britain into Northern Ireland, brushing off concerns that it will break international law.
The European Union has offered ways to reduce checks and paperwork, and appealed to the British government to return to dialogue to find joint solutions, but the British government has said these proposals do not go far enough.
The Taoiseach said he feared the British government did not want to find a solution, saying there was an “the absence of political will”.
“Unionist politicians have raised legitimate questions issues around the operation of the Protocol. And we believe, the European Union believes, that it can resolve these issues,” he said.

“The fundamental question remains as to what the British government’s ultimate position is.
“I just simply do not detect sustained political will on behalf of the UK government to settle this and resolve it. Because without question it can be resolved.”
The Taoiseach thanked the European Commission’s vice president and Brexit point man Maroš Šefčovič for leading talks with Britain. “If there was a Nobel Prize for patience, he would win it hands down,” he said to laughter from the parliament.

Micheál Martin said words must be ‘urgently matched by deeds’, as he announced commitments to help vulnerable countries deal with the climate crisis.
Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told world leaders that this generation must “step up urgently” to tackle the climate crisis.
Martin was delivering Ireland’s national statement today (8 November) atCOP27, the UN climate summit taking place in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt.
“Climate change is fuelling conflict, global instability, competition for resources and abject human misery,” he said.
“If this generation doesn’t step up urgently, future generations will not forgive us. As leaders, it is our responsibility to drive the transformation necessary.”
‘Our citizens will become increasingly cynical, weary and hopeless if words are not urgently matched by deeds’– MICHEÁL MARTIN
For Ireland’s part, Martin said the country will do everything in its power to bring about a more sustainable world.
The country has already set legally binding targets toreduce emissions by 51pcby 2030 and reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050.
However, emissions have beenon the risethis year and the Environmental Protection Agency recently warned that“urgent” measures are neededfor Ireland to meet its climate targets.
Martin acknowledged in his national statement at COP27 that achieving these targets will be “challenging”, so the country has brought in a legal framework to guide and underpin climate efforts.
He also noted that the burden of the climate crisis is falling most heavily on those least responsible, which is why Ireland published its International Climate Finance Roadmap.
Martin said the country is doubling its finance to at least €225m a year by 2025. It is also contributing €10m to the Global Shield initiative for 2023, which aims to help vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters.
“We can already see and feel the world around us changing,” he added.
“Our citizens will become increasingly cynical, weary and hopeless if words are not urgently matched by deeds; if commitments do not generate new realities.”
Martin said atCOP26 last yearin Glasgow that it was not too late to address the climate crisis. “I believe it even more so now,” he said this afternoon.
“This generation of leaders cannot say that we didn’t know. The science is clear. Every tonne of carbon warms the world. Every delay makes our task that bit bigger.
“Let us not waste a second more.”

Shawn Pogatchnik,Sunak seeks negotiated solution to Brexit trade row in first talks with Ireland,Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin says new British leader sounds 'very keen' to strike a deal with Brussels.,https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-brexit-trade-tensions-ireland-talks-protocol/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,europeanvoice,general,en,us,2022-11-10T21:57:17+00:00,"Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin says new British leader sounds ‘very keen’ to strike a deal with Brussels.
DUBLIN — Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made his first diplomatic foray into Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade dispute Thursday as he pledged to seek a compromise agreement with the EU that would be strong enough to revive the U.K. region’s cross-community government.
“What I want to do is find a negotiated solution preferably. I’m pleased with the progress that we’re making in these early days in this job. My focus is to try and find a resolution [and] get the institutions back up and running,” Sunak said after holding his first talks with Irish Prime MinisterMicheál Martinat a hotel in Blackpool, northwest England.
Sunak became the first Conservative prime minister to attend the British-Irish Council, one of the few cooperative institutions created by Northern Ireland’s1998 peace accordthat is still functioning.
Every six months, the council brings together regional government leaders from across Britain and Ireland. While Labour Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown took personal charge of council sessions, the Conservatives had always opted to send junior Cabinet ministers since gaining power in 2010.
Underscoring the remaining diplomatic gulf between London and Brussels, Sunak described thetrade protocol— agreed by his predecessor Boris Johnson as part of the U.K.’s 2019 Withdrawal Agreement with the EU — as “threatening Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.”
His words reflect the reality that the protocol places EU-required checks on British goods as they enter Northern Ireland, which unlike the rest of the U.K. still must enforce EU single market rules on goods. That’s the regulatory price for Northern Ireland to keep trading freely across its land border with the EU, a condition required by the north’s Irish nationalists and the Irish government.
The north’s main British unionist party, theDemocratic Unionists, has refused to revive the power-sharing government in Belfast unless Sunak’s government overrides its treaty with the EU and abolishes what it calls an “Irish Sea border.” As a direct consequence, the Northern Ireland Assembly and its cross-community administrationcollapsedon October 28, wrecking a core institution of the Good Friday Agreement.
While the U.K. government’s Northern Ireland secretary, Liz Truss appointee Chris Heaton-Harris, hadrepeatedly insistedhe would call an immediate new assembly election if Stormont collapsed, he relented once the reality of power-sharing’s failure sank in.
Instead, on Wednesday he announcedplansthat would create a new, similarly amendable deadline of April 13 for that election. Ireland and most Northern Irish partieswelcomedthe move.
“There is a window of opportunity with the election being postponed for an agreement to be arrived at,” Martin said after meeting Sunak.
“The British government along with the European Union is now very determined to engage and to work through this and to see if we can get an agreement,” Martin said. “I’m very clear after the meeting that the U.K. government and the prime minister is very, very keen on getting a negotiated settlement.”
Behind the scenes, U.K. and Irish officials agreed that Sunak’s attendance was intended to signal an increased British government focus on safeguarding the gains of the Good Friday Agreement following six years of Brexit-driven tensions that have pushed London and Dublin apart.
In Blackpool, Sunak also met face to face with Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and by video link with Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford.
While leaders of the Northern Ireland Executive normally attend council meetings, none were present Thursday because that executiveno longer exists. In their place cameJayne Brady, director of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, who discussed the need for Westminster to provide more decision-making powers to department heads left without a minister.
Sunak’s government does appear more focused on achieving an agreement with Brussels that minimizes paperwork and physical checks at Northern Irish ports via live data-sharing with EU authorities, a condition of the protocol agreement that the U.K. was supposed to roll out last year and is belatedly being field-tested this month with EU authorities.
Such data-sharing would help port officials to pinpoint goods most at risk of crossing the Irish border into the EU, allowing most shipments from Britain to avoid sanitary and customs controls.

BreakingNews.ie,"Granting EU candidate status to Ukraine sends message of solidarity, says Taoiseach",Micheál Martin also accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of 'weaponising' food amid ongoing blockades of Ukrainian grain,https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/taoiseach-granting-eu-candidate-status-to-ukraine-sends-message-of-solidarity-1324138.html,breakingnews,general,en,ie,2022-06-23T11:12:50+00:00,"David Young, PA
Europe is sending a message of solidarity to Ukraine by granting the country EU candidate status, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.
He was speaking in Brussels at what he described as a “very significant” and “historic” two-day meeting of the European Council when Ukraine will be formally granted candidate status for future EU membership.
The move comes as war continues to rage in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion in February.
Speaking to reporters, the Taoiseach also raised fears over the prospect of famines in parts of the world due to Russian blockades on Ukrainian grain leaving the country.


The council meeting is expected to see EU candidate status granted to both Ukraine and Moldova. Georgia’s bid to become a member state will also be acknowledged with the country formally designating as having a European perspective – a step below candidate status.
“This is a very significant European Council meeting,” said Mr Martin.
“It’s historic in the sense of the enlargement of the European Union and I’m particularly pleased as a long-standing advocate for Ukraine’s application to candidate status to become a member of the European Union.
“It’s very significant for Ukraine, very significant for Moldova and, indeed, Georgia, in terms of European perspective.




“We in Ireland know what the European Union means, being a member of the European Union. It’s the 50th anniversary of Ireland’s decision to join the European Union, probably the single most transformative decision and event that happened in modern Irish history.
“So, I always cannot comprehend how we could ever refuse accession to other member states, because we know that membership itself can be transformative.
“It can spur on reforms, can spur on economic development, and notwithstanding that Ukraine is going through a terrible, terrible, inhumane war, their cities and towns have been levelled, their people have been terrorised – the greatest humanitarian crisis since World War Two.
“And I think today the European Union is sending a message of solidarity to the people of Ukraine that you belong to the European family, you belong to the European Union, and the decision will be taken today to facilitate your application and you will have candidate status to join the European Union along with Moldova and, over time, with Georgia.”
On the issue of blockades on Ukrainian grain exports, Mr Martin accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger.
“There (are) no sanctions against the movement of food and Europe has been very clear about that because we do not want to, in any shape or form, be a catalyst for any famine or hunger and that’s the big fear at the moment because of the fact that grain is not getting out of Ukraine, that there could be very significant impacts in terms of famine and that’s a big worry, particularly around the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and so on,” he said.
Asked to comment on claims that Irish imports of some Russian goods have actually increased, Mr Martin added: “All the safeguards have been taken. We’re very alert to our role as a country to make sure that the sanctions are enforced and are adhered to and we’ll be taking every precaution (at the) ports and general surveillance to prevent that from happening.
“But on food and materials that give rise to the production of food, we’re very clear – there are no sanctions in relation to that because people need food around the world.
“Putin has weaponised food, he’s weaponised energy, he’s weaponised migration as part of his overall war effort, which I think is wholly immoral and wrong.”

I’m rapidly coming to the conclusion that Brexit is failing in execution because its architects may have felt that in just getting the decision made all the rest would follow as a matter of course.
A good outcome is hard to achieve if you’ve not figured out what it can or should mean in practice. Into this mess the calmest political leader on these islands stepped in to ask for some real engagement:

Of course it didn’t go down well everywhere. The Express accused the Taoiseach of ‘losing it’when he challenged the BBC interviewer Sophie Raworth on her perspective on business opinion in NI.
David Trimblereportedlycalled it a diatribe. It’s likely a difference in political styles in political combat between Ireland and Britain. And Martin’s strength (whether you agree or not) is being across the detail.
It is hard to look past the economic figures. Politicoreports:
TheOffice of National Statistics foundthat Northern Ireland’s gross domestic product grew 1.4 percent in the July-September quarter of 2021, compared with gains of 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent in Scotland and England, respectively. Economic activity in Wales shrank 0.3 percent over the same quarter.
London’s globally connected economy masked a wider English malaise. While the capital recorded 2.3 percent growth, only two of England’s eight other regions eked out any gains. The northeast, including Newcastle and Sunderland, fared worst, with a 1.2 percent slump.
However as Europe Minister James Cleverly notes, the reasons areprobably not as obviousas the Taoiseach implies. He has said:
“Some of the elements we know to be true is that the public sector in Northern Ireland is proportionally larger than in many other parts of the UK,” the minister said. “That is perhaps more resilient to the economic shocks we’re seeing globally and across the UK.”
I’ve long held the view that NI’s large public sector would mean that whichever way Brexit went Northern Ireland would never have suffered the same sort of shocks as other parts of the UK (or indeed the island).
However, the unmade bed that is Brexit is freaking business out. In recent years NI’s manufacturing export base has been vanishingly small (a discontinuity from its industrial past).
Now, as Martin points out, it’s had its highest growth in 19 years. That’s not to be sniffed or sniggered at. It is not all about the protocol either. Northern Ireland has been improving for a while.
In robustly challenging David McWilliams’caricature of a backwoodsman-driven Northern Ireland, Pete Shirlownotesthat Northern Ireland’s..
Agribusiness feeds 10 million people in the UK, and the new economy around cybercrime, fintech, legal services and cultural production drives up skills and wages. Belfast, a city in which around a quarter of the retail space was bombed, was in 2017 ranked seventh for gross value added out of 179 local area regions in the UK.
Leadership from Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness imagined and delivered the new economy. The majority of pro-union people support marriage equality and abortion rights, snarling only at those who oppose them. Many unionists know and articulate the NI protocol as a unique opportunity while others have taken a hapless and distorted route.
Since 2005, for example, sectarian crime has fallen by some 60 per cent. Investors, entrepreneurs, community leaders and researchers drive change and think not of sectarian ways. Irrespective of background they contribute to wealth creation, social economy and anti-poverty campaigns. Knowing what is happening beyond the spreadsheet and the travails of identity politics advances reasonable understandings of the North.
And the Taoiseach continues by observing that (for the moment), local firms have an opportunity to expand their international business. He cites Wrightbus’s contract with Cologne for hydrogen buses.
The very real issues on east west trade should be fixable, but they cannot be fixed without some form of multilateral agreement to free Northern Ireland up as a destination for UK domestic goods supplies.
Nor will hapless threatening the DUP with cutting MLA wages over never never legislation. Grace period extensions will buy time for the UK, just the House of Lords may buy time for the EU over the latest bill.
We may have to wait for a new UK PM before this gets sorted, either a more pragmatic Conservative replacement for Boris Johnson or after a general election a whole new parliamentary configuration?
But there’s only one way home, and that’s back to the negotiation table.

Christina Finn reports from New York:
TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said there is no room for energy companies to exploit the current energy crisis by hiking up standing charges for customers.
Speaking in New York, he said that the Government is considering the matter amid reports that some companies are increasing standing charges by up to €300.
“In relation to standing charges, we will be examining that also. There is no room for energy companies to exploit this situation in any shape or form and I would be concerned by any increase in standing charges in terms of how they would impact on the public.
“There needs to be really clear transparency around all of this and proper explanations and accountability around all of this by the energy companies to the public and to government on this issue,” he said.
There should be no vagueness around why these charges are being loaded on customers.
Speaking about vulnerable customers, the Taoiseach said “the codes are there and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) have made it very clear that no one should be switched off because of difficulties. Especially those with medical requirements should have no fears about being disconnected at any time during the crisis”.

In terms of the increased revenues that energy companies are receiving because of the crisis, Martin said the Government will take measures in the context of the European framework and a windfall gain.
“The State will procure some of that windfall gain and allocate that back to consumers and households,” he said.
When asked about increasing food prices and whether the Government would ever consider food stamps or grocery vouchers, the Taoiseach said:
“No, the more general approach will be in terms of providing financial support across different instruments that we have at our disposal.
“An energy credit is one, there will be taxation measures in the budget in terms of reducing the tax burden.”
“Only this week paediatric charges inpatient charges have been abolished, that will save any family with a child going into hospital up to €800 a year,” he added.
He said the waiving of transport fees for school transport has already saved families €650, adding that the Government will be looking at further areas where it can reduce costs across the board.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said he believes the country can accommodate more refugees arriving from Ukraine.
As pressure mounts on the Government to source accommodation, he told reporters in Trim, Meath: “I think we can stretch ourselves more in terms of accommodating more.”
He did not agree that there has been a waning of social cohesion and support for housing refugees, stating that in a short space of time the country has managed to accommodate over 55,000 Ukrainians.
The Taoiseach, who was attending the Women and Agriculture Conference, said attendees approached him today to voice their support in the effort to take in Ukrainians.
“I understand the pressures given the sheer numbers that are involved,” he acknowledged, but added: “We’re going to do everything we can to assist.”
His comments come ahead of an incorporeal Cabinet meeting, due to be held tomorrow, which will sign off on a number of measures to deal with the accommodation crisis.
These include the doubling of the monthly payment for those housing Ukrainians to €800, the use of army barracks and defence force buildings to house refugees, as well as the extension of modular house building.
Hotel accommodation concerns
The issue of hotel accomodation and freeing up more capacity will also be dealt with.
Over the weekend, the Taoiseach said there is a need to free up capacity that is already in the system, stating that there is an issue with refugees that are currently staying in hotel accomodation not wanting to move on.
Martin told reporters “there was a reluctance, for example, for quite a number of whom are in hotels to move out into housing”.
“There’s been a constant challenge there, because, understandably, if people are in a hotel with a group, they find some comfort in that, and are more reluctant to move into a single house. And that’s been a feature. So these are issues that we have to deal with now, in terms of trying to create greater capacity within the accommodation that we’ve already secured,” said the Taoiseach.
It is understood that hotel contracts to house refugees will now not include meals.
While one source said “we will not see people go hungry”, there will be a concerted effort to urge those staying in hotels to accept other accommodation, such as pledged houses, that could be located in other areas of the country.

Consideration is also being given to asking for a rent contributions to be made by those refugees staying in hotels who are also in employment.
Charged rent if houses turned down
A person may also be charged rent for their stay if they are offered other accommodation, such as a house in another county, but refuse to leave hotel accommodation.
Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said earlier today that tourism in Ireland will be negatively impacted as the war in Ukraine – and the housing of tens of thousands of refugees in hotels – continues.
Around 20% of hotel rooms across the country are being used to accommodate Ukrainians.
Varadkar said it is likely that the tourism sector next spring and summer will not be as good as hoped.
“I think that the war in Ukraine is going to have a negative impact on tourism,” he added.
“You would think it likely that next spring and summer won’t be as good for the tourism sector as maybe we had hoped it would be,” said the Tánaiste.
“It’s not just the fact that maybe 10% or 20% of hotel rooms will be used to accommodate Ukrainians, there’s also the increase in air fares, for example, and reduced consumer sentiments.
“You would think it likely that next spring and summer won’t be as good for the tourism sector as maybe we had hoped it would be.
“But I wouldn’t discount the fact that one of the biggest difficulties the sector has is in finding staff.
“Still, when I meet new people in business, whether it’s Dublin Chamber or Dungarvan Chamber, finding staff is as big an issue, if not a greater issue than the energy costs and it is good to see that so many Ukrainians have been issued with PPS numbers and in around 10,000 have entered the workforce, mainly in hospitality and retail.”
He said communities, including many in Donegal, Kerry, Clare and parts of Dublin, should “gain” from welcoming in so many refugees.
Community funding
The community fund could be used to improve schools, public transport and sporting facilities.
“Irish people have welcomed Ukrainians into their communities, which is absolutely correct. But there are parts of the country where there are a lot of Ukrainians, for obvious reasons, because there’s a lot of accommodation there,” Varadkar added.

“I think in recognition of the fact that so many Irish communities have welcomed so many Ukrainians into their communities, that there should be some community gain for that.
“It might be improvements in schools, it might be improvements to public transport, it might be improvements to community services, and it does already exist.
“I think as this crisis is going to continue, and as it becomes prolonged that we need to need to scale that up.”
Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said there is provision in the budget for this type of spending.
He said the government wants to acknowledge that many communities have “opened their doors and their hearts” to so many Ukrainian families and individuals.
“We made an overall provision of around two billion euro, much that of course will be needed directly for the accommodation provision, for social welfare supports, for health supports and so on,” McGrath added.
“We are working closely with Minister [Heather] Humphreys in particular, in relation to what we can do to assist communities.
“We want it to be practical, to be tangible, to make a difference to them, because we recognise that there is strain on service provision and the provision of facilities in many communities that have taken so many people and we are going to have to support them.
“There is a willingness across government to do more to support those communities and I’m confident that the resources are there within the overall.”
He made the comments as the government details of a new 200 million euro scheme to help companies struggling with rising energy costs.
The Ukraine Enterprise Crisis Scheme will assist viable but vulnerable firms of all sizes in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.
It will help firms suffering liquidity problems, and also help those impacted by severe rises in energy costs.

TAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has said that Covid-19 remains “a significant disruptor” in our society but again stressed that we have left the “emergency phase” of the pandemic.
Speaking this afternoon at the re-opening of the Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station in Dublin, Martin said he could not rule in or out the possibility of any restrictions being reintroduced but that vaccination is likely “the key weapon” this autumn.
“I just can’t predict with certainty what will happen, all I can predict is uncertainty,” he said.

Various sectors of the economy are currently being hit by people beingunable to work due to Covid-19, with Martin making specific reference to the continued cancellation of flights due to Covid-hit airlines.
“We’re going through different phases of Covid-19, I described it recently as that we’re now in a disruptive phase in the sense that Covid remains a significant disruptor, a disruptive influence,” Martin said.
As of todaythere are 885 people in hospitalwith Covid-19, an increase from 627 people two weeks ago. In a statement toThe Journallast week, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) also called for the HSE to resume publishing the number of healthcare workers infected.
Martin said today that Covid-19 variants are “not as virulent as they once were” but that levels of vaccination in the community needed to remain high.
A second booster shot is currently being offered to people over 65 and people who are immunosuppressed with the National Immunisation Advisory Committee currently consideringwhether people under 65 should also be invitedto get a second booster shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.
Related ReadsSummer Covid wave causing 'havoc' for businesses struggling with staff shortagesWith cases on the rise, what is the current advice if you catch Covid-19?
“We will wait for NIAC’s advice in relation to the autumn period and in relation to whether for everybody to require a second booster, and I think that would be the key weapon in the fight against Covid for the autumn period,” he said.
Last week, the government agreed toprepare draft legislation that would allow a mask-mandate to be introducedin specific settings if deemed necessary.
No such plans are being considered at present, however, something Martin reiterated today.
“We’re making sure we have legislation, contingency planning through legislation that if we have to bring back mask-mandates for public transport, or indeed for retail, that we would be in a position to do that quickly. But again, we think we’ve moved out of the emergency phase, the public health advice is vaccination and personal responsibility in people taking care is the best approach right now.”

Sánchez cancela su viaje a Irlanda tras el positivo en covid del primer ministro irlandés

El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, no viajará finalmente a Dublín para reunirse con el primer ministro de Irlanda, Micheál Martin, después de que este haya dado positivo en covid-19, según han confirmado fuentes de Moncloa.
Sánchez tenía previsto reunirse este martes con su homólogo irlandés, para cerrar una gira con líderes de la UE previa al Consejo Europeo en la que ha intentado convencer a los socios de que apoyen la posición de España en materia energética.
Martin dio positivo en coronavirus la semana pasada durante un viaje oficial a Estados Unidos, donde tenía previsto reunirse con el presidente Joe Biden para conmemorar San Patricio.
La principal medida que promueve España para cortar el alza de los precios de la energía, pasa por desacoplar el precio del gas al de la electricidad. Esta acción cuenta con el respaldo de países del sur de Europa como Portugal, Italia o Grecia, aunque parece que la gira no ha servido para convencer a los socios más reticentes como Alemania.
En menos de una semana, Sánchez ha viajado a Rumanía, Eslovaquia, Italia, Alemania, Francia y Bélgica para encontrarse con los líderes de estos países, además de los primeros ministros de Portugal y Grecia.

El primer ministro del país, Micheál Martin, señaló que es probable que la cifra de muertos aumente.
“(Esta es) una cifra impactante y habrá más, hay una operación de búsqueda en marcha, tenemos esperanza y rezamos”,dijo.
Durante la noche se confirmó el deceso de cuatro personas, además de las tres víctimas mortales iniciales, explicó la policía nacional irlandesa, la Garda Síochána. Otras ocho personas estaban hospitalizadas y había varios desaparecidos luego de la explosión que arrasó la estación de servicio de Applegreen en Creeslough, una comunidad de unos 400 habitantes en el condado de Donegal.
“La búsqueda y recuperación de más víctimas continúa”,señalaron las autoridades. La causa de la explosión está siendo investigada.
Equipos de emergencias de Irlanda y la vecina Irlanda del Norte participan en el operativo. Los perros rastreadores examinaron los escombros y una excavadora mecánica levantó montones de escombros de la escena.
La explosión arrasó el edificio de la gasolinera, donde estaban la principal tienda y la oficina de correos de la localidad, y causó daños en inmuebles cercanos.
Martin calificó la jornada como una de las “más oscuras para Donegal y para todo el país”.
“La gente en toda la isla quedará paralizada por la misma sensación de conmoción y absoluta devastación que (tienen) los habitantes Creeslough ante esta trágica pérdida”, apuntó.

La cátedra Romanes es un prestigiado discurso que se pronuncia en la Universidad de Oxford cada otoño desde 1892.
Entre quienes han estado encomendados con esa responsabilidad figuranTheodore Roosevelt(1910),Winston Churchill(1930) eIsaiah Berlin(1970).
Este año le tocó al primer ministro irlandésMicheál Martin,quien hizo una detallada exposición de los retos que está enfrentando la democracia en diversas partes del mundo.
“Ha emergido la cuestión de si la política moderada puede sobrevivir en el marco de un enconado debate público, que se ha vuelto más populista y divisorio”, afirmó Martin.
Para el líder de Fianna Fáil, uno de los dos partidos tradicionales de la política irlandesa, dicha polarización está “carcomiendo la habilidad de desarrollar respuestas efectivas a problemas complejos”.
La República de Irlanda es un país cuyo PIB per cápita no ha dejado de crecer desde 2012. Ni siquiera la pandemia lo ha frenado. En 2001 era de 28 mil dólares anuales; dos décadas más tarde está a punto de superar los 100 mil.
Martinasumió la jefatura del gobierno irlandés hace dos años mediante un acuerdo entre su partido y elFine Gael,su rival histórico.
“El factor más corrosivo para la democracia ha sido, sin duda, la prevalencia de la narrativa populista”, expusoMartinen Oxford. La “viralidad del odio” que actualmente experimentan muchas sociedades está “íntimamente ligada con la diseminación de la desinformación y el desgaste de la idea, alguna vez axiomática, de que había hechos que podían ser aceptados por todos”, argumentó.
Para el primer ministro irlandés, el Acuerdo de Viernes Santo, que en 1998 puso fin a la violencia política en el Úlster, hubiera sido impensable en un ambiente como el actual, pues su firma requirió de una negociación “lenta, respetuosa y confidencial”, algo que contrasta con la “atmósfera de comentarios estridentes e inflexibilidad, tan común hoy en foros públicos”.
Revisando el discurso de Martin, me quedo pensando en el esfuerzo que se requirió para salir del autoritarismo que dominó la vida pública de México durante buena parte del siglo XX.
Fue fundamental, desde luego, el empuje ciudadano a favor de la democracia que se dio en las décadas de los años 80 y 90, pero también el talento de los políticos que supieron negociar condiciones aceptables para todos: el presidente Ernesto Zedillo y los líderes de los tres principales partidos de ese tiempo, es decir, el panistaCarlos Castillo Peraza,el perredistaPorfirio Muñoz Ledoy el priistaSantiago Oñate,entre otros.
Ahora se pretende dar al traste con ese exitoso pacto —que permitió un reparto pacífico del poder—, mediante una reforma electoral promovida desde el gobierno con el objetivo contrario: su concentración.
“Uno de los grandes pensadores liberales del siglo pasado,Isaiah Berlin,hablando aquí mismo (…) tenía claro que el peligro fundamental para la democracia liberal son aquellos convencidos de su causa que se niegan a creer que los acuerdos son deseables o incluso posibles”, expusoMartin.
En días recientes, el presidenteAndrés Manuel López Obradorha llamado a los mexicanos a “tomar partido” en torno de su propuesta de reforma electoral, que es una manera de negar la conveniencia de construir acuerdos entre personas que piensan distinto.
Por eso la ofensiva contra el INE, que fue fruto de una negociación entre hombres sensatos, quienes sabían que México sólo tenía dos opciones de futuro posibles para solucionar las diferencias en la sociedad: la democracia o la violencia.
Quitar al INE del camino no sólo significa privilegiar la toma de postura por encima del diálogo entre distintos. Es mucho peor: tratar de hacer imposible una salida negociada a los conflictos y sustituir la razón por la imposición. Es, en pocas palabras, romper la mesa a hachazos para que nadie esté siquiera tentado de sentarse a negociar.",Positive

Les Premiers ministres britannique Boris Johnson et irlandais Micheal Martin se sont joints lundi à la classe politique nord-irlandaise pour les adieux à David Trimble, prix Nobel de la paix pour avoir contribué à mettre fin à des décennies de conflit dans la province britannique.
Les Premiers ministres britanniqueBoris Johnsonet irlandais Micheal Martin se sont joints lundi à la classe politique nord-irlandaisepour les adieux à David Trimble, prix Nobel de la paix pour avoir contribué à mettre fin à des décennies de conflit dans la province britannique.
Les Premiers ministres britannique Boris Johnson et irlandais Micheal Martin se sont joints lundi à la classe politique nord-irlandaise pour les adieux à David Trimble, prix Nobel de la paix pour avoir contribué à mettre fin à des décennies de conflit dans la province britannique.
Ce conflit connu sous le nom de « Troubles » a fait quelque 3 500 morts et a pris fin avec l'Accord du Vendredi Saint en 1998.
Malgré les profondes divisions aggravées récemment par le Brexit, les représentants de la classe politique nord-irlandaise se sont rendus à la mi-journée à l'église presbytérienne Harmony Hill à Lisburn, au sud-ouest de Belfast pour ses obsèques. Etaient présents, aux côtés de la famille, des unionistes, dont faisait partie Trimble, mais aussi républicains comme la dirigeante du Sinn Fein Michelle O'Neill, amenée à diriger le prochain gouvernement d'union après la victoire historique de sa formation aux élections de mai.
« L'éventail de ceux qui se sont rassemblés pour lui rendre hommage témoigne non seulement de l'impact de David sur le paysage politique mais aussi de l'empreinte qu'il a laissée sur ce paysage et de l'héritage qu'il nous a laissé à tous », a souligné la révérend Fiona Forbes en ouvrant la cérémonie.
Elle a rappelé que David Trimble était « un universitaire, un chef de parti, un artisan de la paix, un lauréat du prix Nobel, le premier à occuper le poste de Premier ministre dans le nouvel exécutif d'Irlande du Nord établi dans le cadre de l'accord du Vendredi Saint. »
Juriste protestant entré en politique au début des années 1970 dans les rangs du parti unioniste Vanguard, proche des paramilitaires, David Trimble a contribué à façonner, un quart de siècle plus tard, l'accord de paix avec feu le catholique John Hume, colauréat du Nobel. Il a pour cela dû surmonter la résistance de la communauté protestante qu'il représentait.
Il a ensuite dirigé le premier exécutif local réunissant unionistes et républicains en vertu de l'accord de paix, entre 1998 et 2002.
Des registres de condoléances ont été ouverts dans toute l'Irlande du Nord. Au siège du gouvernement, une couronne de fleurs a été déposée devant un portrait de David Trimble.
« Il n'y aurait pas eu de paix sans lui », a insisté l'ancien Premier ministre Tony Blair, au pouvoir en 1998, sur la BBC Ulster lundi matin. Il a insisté sur « le caractère qu'il lui a fallu pour résister à toutes les critiques qu'il a reçues, aux menaces contre sa propre vie qui ont été proférées » : « A une époque où les gens sont à la recherche d'un véritable exemple de leadership politique, je pense que c'est un très bon exemple. »
Le décès de David Trimble est intervenu dans un moment de vives tensions et de paralysie politique dans la province britannique. Le principal parti unioniste, le DUP, refuse de participer à un exécutif local dirigé par le Sinn Fein, comme prévu par l'accord de 1998, tant que Londres ne met pas fin à certaines dispositions de l'accord de Brexit prévoyant un statut douanier particulier pour l'Irlande du Nord.
Le gouvernement britannique veut remettre en cause certaines dispositions du protocole nord-irlandais par une loi actuellement au Parlement, provoquant des actions en justice de l'Union européenne. Ce statut particulier avait été créé pour éviter le retour d'une frontière physique entre la province et la République d'Irlande après le Brexit, ce qui aurait pu fragiliser la paix.
Mais en maintenant de fait l'Irlande du Nord dans le marché européen, elle crée une frontière de fait avec le reste de la Grande-Bretagne -une trahison pour les unionistes- ce qui ravive les tensions communautaires.
Au lendemain des funérailles, les parlementaires présenteront leurs condoléances officielles à l'ancien Premier ministre lors d'une séance spéciale.

Ue/UkIl primo ministro irlandese Martin:""Il voltafaccia di Johnson mina la fiducia reciproca""
Obtorto Protocollo. Se bisogna dar fede al primo ministro irlandese, Micheal Martin, i rapporti fra il Regno unito a guida Johnson e l’Unione Europea sono «ai minimi storici». Anche perché, ieri, la ministra degli Esteri britannica Liz Truss ha presentato un disegno di legge che emenda il famigerato protocollo nordirlandese (in buona sostanza, la parte di accordo Brexit specifica per il delicato assetto di quel Paese) secondo i desiderata di Londra, con l’introduzione di passaggi liberi e non nel flusso di merci che dalla Gran Bretagna entrano in Irlanda del Nord: via libera per i prodotti che vi rimangono, ma controlli frontalieri per quelli che proseguono verso la Repubblica d’Irlanda.
IL PROTOCOLLOera stato accettato e ratificato nel 2020 e introduceva controlli frontalieri a certi prodotti soprattutto alimentari attraverso i porti del Mare d’Irlanda, un contenzioso su cui i due ex partner si sono scontrati già mesi addietro nel tentativo di raggiungere un terreno comune. Tali controlli sono invisi agli unionisti nordirlandesi, che li vedono come un inaccettabile confine fra Regno Unito e Irlanda del Nord. Johnson insisteva ieri sul fatto che la legislazione introdurrebbe cambiamenti burocratici «relativamente semplici» e ha ammonito che qualora Bruxelles cercasse di rispondere innescando una guerra commerciale, sarebbe «reazione eccessiva».
La mossa getta in picchiata le prospettive dei futuri scambi fra il blocco europeo e il suo ex membro. Martin ha avvertito che si tratta di «una faccenda molto seria, perché va al cuore della questione della fiducia». Cosa ancora più indigesta per Bruxelles, il testo cerca di stemperare il ruolo della Corte di giustizia europea nella supervisione del protocollo stesso, questione di sovranità molto cara agli ultrà brexittieri dell’European Research Group (Erg), corrente alla destra di Johnson assurta a maggior peso per la tenuta del governo dopo la fiducia tiepida espressa solo giorni fa nei confronti della leadership.
NATURALMENTE IL DISEGNOdovrà ora sostenere l’iter parlamentare. Ma già non piace a molti, anzi a quasi nessuno: non solo all’Ue – che appunto la considera una potenziale violazione del diritto internazionale – ma a una sezione dei parlamentari conservatori, alla Camera dei Lord, al mondo dell’impresa nordirlandese, al Labour e agli Stati uniti. Si prevede che l’Ue avvii un procedimento legale contro il Regno unito forse già domani, rincari la dose con il congelamento di tutti i colloqui importanti su ulteriori scambi e cooperazione nella ricerca e applichi sanzioni selettive in quella che si teme una guerra commerciale. Il vicepresidente della Commissione europea, Maros Sefcovic, ha affermato ieri che i piani della Gran Bretagna di annullare il protocollo dell’Irlanda del Nord con una nuova legislazione nazionale «danneggeranno la fiducia reciproca» e causeranno maggiore incertezza.
MA LE CRITICHE PIÙ DURE, il voltafaccia di Londra le ha riscosse da parte irlandese. Oltre al premier, dal suo ministro degli Esteri, Simon Coveney, secondo il quale il piano aumenterà la tensione fra i contendenti e minerà gli impegni internazionali del Regno unito. Johnson è spinto a oltranza dall’intransigenza anti protocollo dell’Erg e dallo stesso Dup, che si è finora rifiutato di consentire al governo nordirlandese di funzionare – Stormont, il parlamento devoluto nazionale a gestione unionista e repubblicana, è inattivo dal 2017 – fino a quando il Protocollo non sarà eliminato o pesantemente emendato. Il suo è un difficile equilibrismo (brinkmanship) rispetto alle spiacevoli – quanto ben note e possibili – conseguenze di un accordo… da lui stesso firmato cinque anni fa.
