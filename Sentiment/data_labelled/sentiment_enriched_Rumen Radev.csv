BSPrepresentatives today returned to President RumenRadevthe unfulfilled third exploratory mandate to form a government, which ended the last opportunity to form a government within the framework of the 47th National Assembly.
The chairman of the parliamentary group of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, Georgi Svilenski, pointed out that within the last 10 days the “Left” has made every effort to form a government within the framework of the 47th National Assembly.
The head of state is about to dissolve the parliament and set a date for early elections.
""Together with the unfulfilled mandate, the ruling coalition bequeaths to the cabinet the crisis in the energy sector, which can turn into a collapse of the economy and the social system,"" commented RumenRadevin turn, who pointed out that this is the government's heaviest legacy.
The president called on the deputies for a quick decision on the chairman of EWRC.
The leader of the “Left”, KorneliaNinova, said for her part that ""we made every effort to solve the problem with Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC)"":
""We fully understand the burden of theEWRCnot working in the coming difficult months. In this regard, Mr. President, we would like to know, too, do you intend to extend the work of the parliament so that this problem can be solved? "".
To which the President replied:
""Once again, I call on the National Assembly to find a solution to this extremely important case by the end of this week.""

Ninova: We will not be responsible for the energy crisis
“TheBSPdoes not want and will not be responsible for what is happening in the energy sector, and the criticisms that President RumenRadevmade earlier today about the chaos left in the sector are not accepted”, said the leader of the “Left”, KorneliaNinova, after the return of the unfulfilled mandate for cabinet.
Ninovarecommended that the criticism should be directed not at the resigned cabinet and theBSP, but at ""There Is Such a People"", which she pointed out as the specific culprit for what happened, since the Minister of Energy Alexander Nikolov is their nominee:
""A newEWRCchairman cannot be elected in two days and the president knows it very well"".
In addition, KorneliaNinovastated that the president is from the circle of people who overthrew the ruling coalition: “The president has not stopped criticizing this government since its first day, even though he created ‘We Continue the Change’”.
""Obviously there will be no paper ballots and that's a problem for us,"" she added.

SOFIA, July 27 (Reuters) – Bulgaria’s Socialist party abandoned plans on Wednesday to propose a new coalition government after failing to scrape together a majority in parliament, a development that promises fresh elections in the autumn for the Balkan country.
President Rumen Radev will now have to appoint a caretaker cabinet to govern the European Union and NATO member state before fresh elections can be held, most probably in October.
The Socialists had made a third and final go in the bid to form a government after the coalition government of reformist Prime Minister Kiril Petkov was toppled in a no-confidence vote last month, following the loss of its majority.
“It become clear that there is no majority willing to fight corruption … In that case we will return the mandate to form a government to the president unfulfilled tomorrow,” Georgi Svilenski, a senior member of the Socialist party, told reporters.
The Socialists agreed with their partners in the outgoing government on a six-month programme to fight widespread graft and offer measures to help businesses with surging prices, but failed to secure the support of a former ally, the ITN party.
Their attempt to put the programme to a vote in parliament was rejected by deputies, clearly showing their lack of a majority.
The prolonged political gridlock amid surging inflation and war in Ukraine is likely to imperil access to billions of euros in European Union recovery funds for the bloc’s poorest member state and hurt prospects of joining the euro zone in 2024.
It could also affect efforts to secure stable natural gas supplies after Moscow cut off gas deliveries to Bulgaria, almost completely reliant on Russian gas, following Sofia’s refusal to pay in roubles.

The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) will decide tomorrow whether to return the unfulfilledmandateto President RumenRadevor to propose a candidate for prime minister.
This was stated by the chairman of the parliamentary group ofBSP, Georgi Svilenski, during the meeting of the party's Executive Bureau. The meeting of the National Council of the “Left” will be held tomorrow in connection with the implementation of the thirdmandatefor the formation of a government. According to Svilenski, “BSPwill propose to the National Council two options for action, which are in accordance with the Constitution and with a horizon of Friday”.
This means that whatever decision the National Council takes tomorrow afternoon,Ninovawill go to President RumenRadevon Friday - July 29.
Svilenski refused to comment further on what the attitudes are in the party.
At the end of last week,Ninovaset a deadline - until July 27, Wednesday, by which timeBSPmust decide whether to return themandateunfulfilled or to propose a candidate for prime minister. This happened after the live broadcast of the meeting of the parliamentary group of ""Democratic Bulgaria"" and thesubsequent decision of the leader of “There Is Such a People” Slavi Trifonov to ruin the negotiationsfor the resumption of the quadruple coalition between WCC,BSP, DB and TISP.
Whatever the decision of the “Left”, however, it is more and more certain that there will be another early election, and the actions ofBSPwill determine only whether they will be in the beginning or the middle of October. (If themandateis returned this week, the elections will be on October 2. IfBSPkeeps it until August 15, as was the initial request, then the elections should be on October 16).

This is the last attempt to form agovernmentwithin the framework of the 47th National Assembly.
""We Continue the Change"" failed to gather support as the first political force, and GERB-SDS immediately returned themandate- with the idea that special elections are the solution to the political crisis in the country.
According to the Constitution,BSPdoes not have a deadline in which it must return themandate- fulfilled or unfulfilled. According to an interpretative decision from 1992, it is advisable to do this within a week.
During the consultations with the head of state on Friday, the leader of the left, Kornelia Ninova, has already declared readiness for talks on forming agovernmentin this parliament with the previous coalition partners from ""There Is Such a People"", ""We Continue the Change"" and ""Democratic Bulgaria"". She is of the opinion that the prime minister should be nominated by the largest political party in the National Assembly - ""We Continue the Change"", and that there should be mainly political and not expert persons.
Resigned Prime Minister Kiril Petkov also said they would hold talks with everyone except those ""whose strings are being pulled from behind the scenes."" ""There Is Such a People"" and ""Democratic Bulgaria"" are also ready to sit at the negotiating table.

Can the parliament produce a cabinet with the thirdmandateand solve the crises in which the country is. These were the main topics of theconsultationsthatPresidentRumen Radev held with the parliamentary parties today.
“We Continue the Change” (WCC) said that in order to secure a majority for the cabinet, they will conduct negotiations with all the deputies in the parliament who are not dependent on behind-the-scenes forces. For the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the cabinet should be political, not expert, so that it is clear who bears the responsibility. “There Is Such a People” (TISP) are open to dialogue with their previous partners but continue to insist that the leaders step aside. “Democratic Bulgaria” (DB) defined the thirdmandateas a ""dialoguemandate"". For them, the negotiations should be within the framework of the collapsed coalition, and the political leaders should take a step aside.
GERB, The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) and “Vazrazhdane” do not see a working formula in this parliament.
How theconsultationswent
PresidentRumen Radev said that he is conducting theconsultationswith the aim of finding unity around national goals and priorities and in anticipation of making use of the last hope - with the thirdmandateto form a government.

""Apparently, after the new red lines have been drawn, this is not an easy task, but the politicians, both in the parliament and in thegovernment, are there at the will of the Bulgarian citizens, who expect dialogue, compromises, understanding and hard work so that their problems are solved. We need not just a deal for a newgovernment, but an effectivegovernmentwith a strategic horizon to undertake and implement the necessary reforms. That is why it is very important to hear today the position of all parliamentary groups on how they see the formula to get out of the political crisis without a clear solution we cannot cope with solving the other crises,"" said the head of state.
ThePresidentasked to understand the position of ""We Continue the Change""- does the current National Assembly have the potential to issue agovernmentthat is based on values ​​and not on political bargaining. He asked them if they would support agovernmentmandated by another political force.

Kiril Petkov announced that ""We Continue the Change"" would like to avoid the political crisis.
""We have clearly stated and continue to stand on this position very clearly, that we are ready to talk with absolutely all people's representatives from all political forces, who can make their own decisions in the parliament and are not dependent on behind-the-scenes forces that are not in the parliament. This is our readiness and we will continue and we hope to support, if you choose our coalition partner to lead the third term, to support these talks and to remain fully dialogic, of course, without giving the opportunity for the backroom forces to take over the futuregovernment"" - said Petkov.
To the question would ""We Continue the Change"" support agovernmentwith a prime minister raised from their ranks like Nikola Minchev, for example, the resigned prime minister answered:
""Personal candidacies are not important at all. The point is not that this is not important at this moment, the most important thing at this moment is to make sure that we have a parliament that can support thisgovernment, a parliament of people who can make decisions in the parliament"".
The second largest parliamentary group GERB-SDSconfirmed that they insist on early elections. Rumen Radev asked them how they see the resolution of the crises and whether extraordinary elections would stop the growth of the industry reported by the government.

""You, with your great administrative and parliamentary experience, are fully aware of what it means exactly at such critical moments to go to elections, to remain without a parliament, to have transitional periods in which the administration cannot work effectively. We are interested in how you see it besides the issue of power, the problems of the people should also be solved without delay,"" thepresidentpointed out.
""We are here with all the experience and expertise that we have in our parliamentary group and we are ready to participate in theconsultationsto find a way out of the crises. However, this does not mean that our opinion that there cannot be a stable majority in the 47 The National Assembly has changed,"" said Desislava Atanasova, chairwoman of the parliamentary group of GERB-SDS.
After theconsultations, GERB said that they pointed out to thepresidentas one of the reasons for the crises, according to them, that several families run the state as their private company or startup company.
""Is it a secret, is it true that Mr. Lorer's family runs the Ministry of Innovation, the Health Fund and the Ministry of Finance at the same time. Husband and wife. Is it a secret or is it true that the Prime Minister and his chief of staff are in some kind of relationship"", asked Desislava Atanasova.
In order to change the formula of political governance, new elections are needed,the Movement for Rights and Freedoms confirmed its position.

""How do you see your role, your party - what is your recipe for getting out of the crisis, to dialogue?"" asked the head of state.
""A new foundation is needed to have a new house. The previous foundation sets a wrong model, a crooked house. In order to reformulate something new, you have to go to early elections. It is very important to know what there is to do before the early elections and we bear our responsibility,"" said Mustafa Karadayi, chairman of DPS.
After the meeting, Mustafa Karadayi expressed hope that they were useful to thepresidentwith their position and again criticized thegovernmentof Kiril Petkov.
""For the last 32 years, I don't believe there has been a worse cabinet than this one. I think it wasn't even that bad during the time of Zhan Videnov,"" said the DPS chairman.
The Bulgarian Socialist Party came a minute lateand thepresidenthad to wait for them. Kornelia Ninova stated that if they receive themandate, they will make maximum efforts to fulfill it. They stand behind the prepared program during the first term. They will not talk to GERB and DPS

""The parties continue to draw dividing lines. That is why it is important to hear your formula for getting out of the crisis - with whom will you be in dialogue and what program do you have in order to have a sustainablegovernmentthat makes the important decisions,"" pointed out Rumen Radev.
""First of all, we think that the prime minister should be chosen from WCC. They are the first political force in a democracy, it is right - the first to propose the prime minister. Secondly, we prefer political to an expert cabinet, because it means clearly carrying political responsibility."" - emphasized Kornelia Ninova, chairwoman of BSP.
After the meeting, in response to a question, Ninova said that they had not received any indication that themandatewould go to them and specified:
""I told you that the basis for negotiations will not be names, but the program, actions, policies and laws.""
""There Is Such a People"" will also try to produce agovernmentif they get themandate. They are ready to conduct negotiations with the three parties with which they were in a coalition until recently, but they believe that it should be structured in a different way. According to TISP, an expert cabinet is a better option.

""Your party's decision was to leave thegovernment, which faced the 47th National Assembly with the formation of a new governing majority or new elections. On what priorities do you see a majority, are you open to a majority and with which political formations?"" asked the president.
""It would be good, if possible, for the political leaders to step back and in this situation come agovernmentthat within a year or a year and a half or 6 months - as much as they have decided to deal with the crisis, with the most urgent. Thegovernmentto move forward with people who are experts rather than politicians,"" said Toshko Yordanov, the chairman of the parliamentary group of “There Is Such a People”.
According to TISP, thepresidentshould hand over themandateto the party that can find wider support.
""Thepresidentis in a very difficult role at the moment, he must really show himself as a unifier, as a balancer, and his judgment is very important in this extremely difficult moment. It is not by chance that the constitution is introduced at this difficult moment, it is not by chance that it turns the roulette wheels again because it gives a chance - a second chance for everyone,"" said Iva Miteva.
""Democratic Bulgaria"" will work to restore the political dialogue. If they receive themandate, they will conduct negotiations with the previous coalition partners. They believe that the candidate for prime minister must gather a lot of trust. The key task is to restore the majority.

""You said that you will make efforts to form agovernmentwithin the third mandate. You are also conducting a dialogue with all potential partners. How do you see the formula for getting out of the political crisis?"" Rumen Radev asked.
""We propose to see if the political leaders can't take a step back, but if it is political that prevails, we will not insist. We have specific ideas, but first to restore the majority and on that basis we can move forward."" - said the co-chairman of DB Hristo Ivanov.
""Vazrazhdane"" sees early elections as the best solution to the crisis situation. They believe that the current parliament is exhausted.

""You declared early elections, but the problems remain and there is a danger that the same configuration will be repeated in the parliament after these elections,"" stressedPresidentRumen Radev.
""This parliament with this composition will not be functional. It is not certain whether the same configuration will be repeated after elections, only the Bulgarian voter can say that,"" answered the chairman of ""Vazrazhdane"" Kostadin Kostadinov.

""This means that in the remaining days until the end of July, the parliament will be burdened with high expectations both to form a governing majority and to pass important laws. And the government with anti-crisis actions and development of the laws related to theRecovery Plan"", he clarified.
According to him, it is obvious that the political crisis in the country is worsening. ""Any political party with an ambition for public support must clearly state what outcome it offers. The quick and fruitless exhaustion of the procedure for forming a government before the end of July ends the activity of the government and the parliament"", explained Radev.
""According to the Constitution, I must immediately announceelectionswithin two months. That meanselectionsin September, which also carries risks. But, on the other hand, excessively prolonging the procedure for forming a government leads to temptation for gambling management decisions and personnel changes"", added Radev.
The head of state noted that the parties are drawing ever thicker red lines between themselves. Therefore, according to him, forming the government after potential earlyelectionsis becoming more and more difficult.
""I am about to hand over a mandate to the second-largest parliamentary group. If they also return it, I will invite all parties represented in the parliament to consultations to hear what formula they offer for a way out of the crisis, what their attitudes are towards coalitions and what priorities and programs they have,"" he added. Based on that, he will decide who to hand the third folder to.

(RFE/RL) — Bulgaria’s centrist Continue the Change party (PP) has announced that it failed to secure the support of a majority in parliament to put forward a new coalition government.
On July 8, Asen Vassilev, who was expected to be nominated to become Bulgaria’s next prime minister, informed President Rumen Radev that the party had failed to get the backing from at least 121 lawmakers in the 240-seat parliament.
“Unfortunately, we failed to gather enough support to implement the politics that our…government would have wanted to push through,” Vassilev said.
“We could not get the support needed to rid Bulgaria of corruption and make the state work for the people, instead of channeling taxpayers’ money into a few select companies that can use it to corrupt the political class,” the prime minister- designate said.
Vassilev, who served as finance minister in the previous pro-Western government, told a news conference that the party had the support of 117 deputies ready to support the party’s program.
“We hope that in the next elections, the additional four deputies will be elected by the people,”he said.
The party received the mandate to form a government a week ago after a coalition government that it led fell in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last month.
In a bid to cling to power, the PP had put forward Vassilev as their prime minister-designate instead of outgoing Prime Minister Kiril Petkov and proposed to form a government for a six-month term to see through judicial reforms and other measures.
Petkov’s coalition began to fray after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The government, which only took office in December on pledges to tackle high-level corruption, was toppled in the no-confidence vote over disagreements on the economy and whether Sofia should drop opposition to North Macedonia’s European Union accession.
Radev will now hand out two more mandates to form a government. He said the first will go next week to the center-right Citizens for the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party of former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov. A third mandate will be handed out if GERB is unsuccessful.
If the two other attempts fail, the president will dissolve parliament and call new elections to be held within two months. It would be Bulgaria’s fourth parliamentary elections since April last year.
Fresh elections could return a similarly fragmented legislature as did the other three general elections last year after frustrations over corruption led to mass protests against Borisov’s rule.
A recent poll by the Alpha Research institute in the country of 6.5 million showed as many as seven parties passing the 4 percent entry threshold. Borisov’s GERB led the poll with 21.5 percent, followed by PP with 20.2 percent.
RFE/RL journalists report the news in 21 countries where a free press is banned by the government or not fully established.

At 5:00 p.m., the procedure for handing over the firstmandateto form a newgovernmentwithin the framework of the 47th National Assembly by President RumenRadevto the largest political group in the parliament - ""We Continue the Change"" - began.
""Dear representatives of ‘We Continue the Change’, please announce your candidate for Prime Minister"", said President Rumen Radev.
The chairman of the parliamentary group of ""We Continue the Change"" Andrey Gyurov said:
""Dear Mr. President, dear Mrs. Vice-President, the parliamentary group ‘We Continue the Change’ by its decision nominates Mr. AsenVassilevas a candidate for prime minister, who will receive amandateto form agovernment.""
PresidentRadevindicated that in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria and as a result of the vote of no confidence by the National Assembly on June 22, he handed AsenVassilevan exploratorymandateto form a government.
""We all know that Bulgaria is in a political, economic and social crisis. Bulgarians share legitimate concerns about the rising prices and the growing uncertainty and instability. And the reforms and funds under the Recovery and Sustainability Plan are waiting for their implementation. Since yesterday, we also have a foreign policy crisis. You will recall that when handing over themandateto the current outgoinggovernment, I warned that if decisive reforms in the judicial system were not undertaken within the first hundred days, the status quo would seek its revenge. Citizens, society and institutions need certainty and predictability, from a reliable protection of the public interest, and this means, above all, responsibility and efforts to form agovernmentthat meets the interests of the citizens. I expect adequate solutions and the defense of the national interest to build a free, democratic and prosperous European Bulgaria,"" he pointed out before handing the folder with themandateto Vassilev.
Upon receiving the folder from the president with themandate, AsenVassilevsaid:
""For me, this is a huge responsibility. I think we are all aware that with the crises that Bulgaria has to face, it is extremely important to have a cabinet. It is also extremely important that this cabinet works in the interest of the citizens, and not in interest of the status quo and that it really defends the Bulgarian interest and the independence of our country, just as the first cabinet of ‘We Continue the Change’ did”.
After receiving the folder with the exploratorymandate, AsenVassilevhas a 7-day period in which he must present to the president the structure and composition of agovernment, after which PresidentRadevmust propose the nominee for prime minister for a vote in the National Assembly.
If this does not happen, RumenRadevmust hand over amandateto the next largest parliamentary group - GERB-SDS.
Earlier in the day, the resigned Prime Minister Kiril Petkovsaidthat he proposed to nominate the former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance AsenVassilevas the Prime Minister of the next cabinet.
At the beginning of the week, the head of state held political consultations with five of the seven parliamentary formations.
""We Continue the Change"" and the Bulgarian Socialist Party did not attend the talks because of the budget update in the National Assembly. At the talks, GERB, DPS and ""Vazrazhdane"" announced early elections. The best option for ""Democratic Bulgaria"" is agovernmentwith themandateof ""We Continue the Change"". ""There Is Such a People"" are ready to participate in talks about a new cabinet but not at any price.
""The potential for forming agovernmentwithin this parliament has not been exhausted. If we go for the option of elections, before September 15, they are not ideal for the country. It is important to have the greatest possible voter turnout,"" said President Rumen Radev.

“The presidential institution has not received a report fromtheState Agency for National Security (SANS) on the expulsion ofRussiandiplomats. At the Security Council of the Council of Ministers, held on June 9, which was attended by a representative of the presidential institution, this topic was not on the previously announced agenda. It was raised inside for discussion in principle, but no decision was made on it”. This was said by President RumenRadevto the media after the end of theNATOmeeting in Madrid.
He specified that upon the return of the representative of the presidential institution and sharing how the Council went, the presidency sent a letter to the Secretary of the Security Council to the Council of Ministers with a question about the decisions taken. The answer is: No decision has been taken by this council.
“This clearly shows that decisions in the government are apparently taken by some parallel mechanism far from the institutional decision-making path”, the president said.
A meeting of the National Security Advisory Council cannot overturn a decision already taken by the resigned government. The body that controls the Council of Ministers is the Bulgarian Parliament. Even if it resigns, the government is still responsible for its actions, the president reminded.
He is adamant that the consequences of this action could be extremely serious, especially for our diplomatic mission in Moscow. But the important thing is that in this way no decisions can be made in the executive branch on such an important issue. The responsibility lies entirely with the executive branch, no matter that it resigned,Radevadded.
In connection with the handing over of the mandates and the previous consultations, the President said that before sending official letters there is always an agreement by phone for the time convenient for both parties. Such coordination was made with “We Continue the Change” and BSP, after which the letters were sent.
""From then on - what were the reasons for these parties not to appear for consultations, I can not speculate. But it is important that the parties take full responsibility for the mandates that will be given to them. I believe that the potential to form a government in within this Parliament is not exhausted. If we are moving towards the election option, elections before 15 September are not appropriate. It is important to have as much turnout as possible. You can consider two months backward when the earliest cycle can end. The opinion of the parties is also important,"" he added.
Regarding the concludedNATOsummit,Radevsaid: “TheNATOsummit is assessed as historic, not only because it is being held at a crucial moment in a radically changed strategic security environment after Russia's aggression in Ukraine, but because at this summitNATO's new post-2010 strategic concept was adopted, which returns the Alliance to its core mission of guaranteeing the territorial integrity, sovereignty and security of each member state.”
“This is a decision with important consequences for all Member States - to strengthen their defense potential, and for the countries of the Eastern Flank - to develop their logistics system, infrastructure and connectivity. For Bulgaria, it means working actively and usingNATO's financial mechanisms.”
“The meeting at a high political level considered only the potential for expanding the multinational battle group to the rank of a brigade”,Radevsaid. He said that Bulgaria should be much more active in building the relevant capabilities in order for such a battle group to function.
At the summit, the beginning of theNATOInnovation Fund was set, in the basis of which, as an idea, Bulgaria has a serious contribution, he added.

“I cannot discuss this issue because I do not have the necessary information”,Radevsaid.
“I hope the resigned Prime Minister Kiril Petkov has solid and reliable information about this decision and has considered it well both in terms of scale and consequences”, said the head of state.
The leaders will discuss at a high political level the further strengthening of the Eastern Flank by increasing the multinational battle groups to the brigade level. Operational decisions have yet to be taken at the military-political level.
Radevdescribed the meeting as starting at a key moment in a radically changed strategic security environment as a result of Russian aggression in Ukraine and increased competition between the main strategic players on the global stage.
According to him, after decades of focusing on the fight against terrorism in remote regions,NATOis returning to its main role - protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member countries.
Yesterday,NATOSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that Turkey wasgiving its supportto Sweden and Finland's membership inNATOafter Ankara blocked their candidacies in May. The three countries signed a memorandum in response to Turkish concerns.

PresidentRadev commented that the political crisis is extremely important because people expect efforts from politicians in this complex situation. He praised the consistent policy ofDemocratic Bulgariafor judicial reform, which has fallen out of the focus of the cabinet. He warned that if decisive reforms are not undertaken in the first 100 days, the status quo will seek revenge. “There are steps, but the closure of the special courts is only the first step in the long and important road that must be taken. It is very important to find a balance between the fact that it takes time and effort on the part of the parties to form a new cabinet, and at the same time there is a lot of work to be done to adopt the budget and to lay a legislative basis for adopting the Recovery and Sustainability Plan. The big topic is the overall assessment of the political situation and whether this National Assembly has the potential to form a new governing majority, whether the boring professionalism or the square drive to consolidate more followers is more important”, Radev said.
Hristo Ivanov replied that theconsultationsare precisely an anti-crisis measure, insofar as the purpose of the Constitution is to have agovernmentelected and to prevent early elections. “The crisis has another aspect - of the political class, where everything is too personal and the essential issues cannot be discussed. In that sense, theconsultationsare an important element of the attempt to restore the opportunity for conversation”, Ivanov said. He added that it is very important to try to form a cabinet with the first term, as it is the one with the highest expectations. He noted that the focus on judicial reform should continue, with broad agreement on its implementation.
He expressed skepticism that new elections would give a magical solution to the problems.
Talks today began with ""There Is Such a People""; a meeting with ""Vazrazhdane"" is forthcoming.

Consultations withPresidentRumenRadevto form a new government within this parliamentcontinuetoday. The first meeting is with representatives of ""There Is Such a People"".
PresidentRumenRadevhas said that resolving crises requires clear decisions from politicians in order to respond to people's growing concerns about prices and the war in Ukraine. He also expects an ambitious and consistent foreign policy in order to prevent Bulgaria from remaining on the periphery of the EU. “Tolerance in Bulgarian politics is very short”,Radevsaid, noting TISP's consistent policy towards North Macedonia. “It takes time and effort to form a government, but also urgent action to pass the budget and important laws on which the Recovery and Sustainability Plan depends”,Radevsaid.
The chairman of the parliamentary group of ""There Is Such a People"" Toshko Yordanov commented that it is satisfactory for them that thepresidentacts responsibly - something that is not realized by some political parties. “Your role is extremely important, it is wonderful that you are clearly aware of it and do not hide. Thank you for appreciating the consistency”.
He asked for thepresident's advisory board in January to be declassified to see which politicians are lying about North Macedonia.
“You decide, at that council things were not said that could threaten national security, but many lies were told”, said Toshko Yordanov.
According to him, they are aware of the situation and will do everything in their power without crossing moral boundaries.
""I want everyone to be able to express their opinion freely, so far I have declassified a transcript of the Corporate Commercial Bank only after obtaining the consent of all participants, but it is important because these are difficult decisions, I do not want to compromise freedom of expression in the next consultative councils. The great sin of the Bulgarian political class for the last 30 years is that they have forgotten the Macedonian Bulgarians, this is not mentioned in the Good Neighbour Agreement of 2017, nor in the framework position, nor the veto imposed by GERB 2020, which was imposed by the dispute over language"", commented Rumen Radev.
“The main demand is equality for Bulgarian citizens, who must be registered alongside other state-building nations through a change in the country's constitution”, the head of state added.
Talks with ""Democratic Bulgaria"" and ""Vazrazhdane"" are forthcoming.
Yesterday,GERBandDPSresponded to thepresident's invitation. ""We Continue the Change"" andBSPpostponed the consultations until the state budget is adopted.

After welcoming theDPSrepresentatives, RumenRadevdescribed the moment as ""challenging"".
""I will not list all the crises, I will add only one - the political one,""Radevsaid. He called on politicians not to allow Bulgaria to remain on the periphery of Europe. According to the head of state, “therefore, a more ambitious, unified and consistent foreign policy is needed”.
""The responsible attitude of your movement towards ethnic peace is a fact, you have always called for dialogue. But Bulgaria expects equal efforts from all parties in the fight against corruption. Your party is aware of the high stakes of this challenge,""Radevsaid.
""I expect responsible work from the 47th National Assembly. I hope the parties will enter into a constructive dialogue,"" thepresidentsaid. However,Karadayiruled out the possibility and said new elections were needed.
He said thefall of the government""is the natural end of a policy based on lies and hatred"".
""The last coalition is not based on values ​​and policies, but on negation. Its whole activity was based on a lie. In the National Assembly, we tried to expose the lies. The way out of the political crisis we are in is a prerequisite for finding a solution to other crises as well. It began with a successful vote of no confidence in the failed government, which refused dialogue with the opposition in search of solutions to the crisis, but later it became clear that there was a refusal of dialogue in the ruling majority. In this way, we cannot find a solution to the crises,""Karadayisaid.
""They called themselves 'change' and wanted to suggest that violating the Constitution and the laws is a normal practice if done by the right people,""Karadayisaid.
""We from the Movement of Rights and Freedoms pursue a consistent policy. We have more than once had the opportunity to share with you that we want to restore normalcy in politics. We are strongly in favor of the fight against corruption and the rule of law. We need to restore democracy, statehood and normalcy in politics,"" theDPSleader added.
""Bulgaria should submit its recovery and sustainability plan and operational programs as soon as possible. The budget had to be in line with them. At the moment, we do not have a sustainability plan or operational programs,""Karadayisaid. ""It is difficult to find that dialogue in this National Assembly in order to have a definite Euro-Atlantic government in Bulgaria. We need to turn again to the voters so that they burden the political parties with a certain responsibility. To enter the next parliament with values, goals and proposals for priorities of the state. Let's look for a value-homogeneous Euro-Atlantic governance,""Karadayisaid.
The country's priorities, according to the Movement, must now be energy and food security and independence.

TheFrenchpresidency's proposal to resolve the dispute shook the Macedonian government after three small parties threatened to leave if the cabinet approved a draft sent to the Bulgarian parliament to end the dispute between Skopje and Sofia.
The Left Democratic Union, the green DOM (Democratic Renewal forMacedonia) and the Liberal Democratic Party announced one after the other for several hours that they would step down because of the ""unacceptable"" document.
The reason is that while inBulgariaPresident Rumen Radev considers insufficient the guarantees in the documents on the ""French"" proposal (and especially the bilateral protocol), in NorthMacedoniathe opposition and these allies of the government see too great concessions from Skopje.
""The whole history needs to be changed""
Even the mere mention, in the draft of a negotiating framework, of the Macedonian language and givingBulgariathe right to unilaterally express its position that the language does not exist was perceived as a ""red line"". This unleashed the tensions that existed at the beginning of the veto crisis and those in the public space around the Prespa Treaty with Greece over the constantly repeated notion that ""language and identity are not negotiated"".
The three parties are small but would be enough to level the playing field in parliament: 60 to 60 deputies. Currently, the majority of Prime Minister DimitarKovachevskiis 64 people.
And there, as inBulgaria, suggestions about the content of the documents appeared in the public space: for example, that NorthMacedoniamust completely revise its history, including because of the reference in the protocol to Art. 8 of the Good Neighborly Agreement for the need for objective work with historical sources and others.
""I cannot accept the whole history we studied in primary and secondary school, to now change it and prove that it is a false history imposed on us by the Communists,"" LDP chairman Goran Milevski said in an interview. ""If the government accepts theFrenchproposal as it is, I will resign irrevocably as a member of the government,"" he said.
And from other wings in the ruling Social Democratic Union. ""We must not give up Macedonianism,"" said former SDSM prime minister and president Branko Crvenkovski, as the ""French"" proposal would open Pandora's box with more demands fromBulgariaand seek a compromise on ""our identity and history.""
Such thesis could not be defended: ""We are not negotiating for identity, we will negotiate for history,"" Crvenkovski added.
Conditions
The Macedonian Prime Minister continues to claim that no official document has yet been received by the government of North Macedonia. Yesterday, however, he wrote on Facebook that whatever the final text is, some elements are key to making it acceptable:
The ""French"" proposal currently envisions the constitutional procedure being completed by the intergovernmental conference, at which real talks will begin, and before that there will be a political intergovernmental conference, at which Skopje will learn about the actual steps in the talks.

“We would not have received the French proposal, which is the best so far ifBulgariahad not vetoed two enlargement councils last year with a clear position and argument”.
“The position I shared is already clear and our European partners are aware of the position that the issue of upholding civil rights can not only be bilateral betweenBulgariaand theRNMbut to rise at the EU level”. This was stated by Bulgarian President RumenRadevtoday.
“The issue of the rights of Macedonian Bulgarians is already in the negotiating framework. Bulgarian politicians should not rush to declare a historic victory, because the change in the constitution is not a victory, but a step on the path to integration. The real protection of the Bulgarian interests, of our cultural and historical heritage of the rehabilitation of the victims and the termination of the process of demoralization, depends on the content of the bilateral protocol“,Radevadded.
“At present, the proposed bilateral protocol withNorth Macedoniadoes not provide a sufficient guarantee for the protection of our interests such as actions, mechanisms and deadlines and criteria. I call on the responsible institutions to set the missing parameters in this bilateral protocol because if it is not updated, the negotiating framework itself becomes meaningless, it is a framework”,Radevsaid. “I call on the Council of Ministers not to hide behind the National Assembly, it is the leading institution and we expect to make clear and responsible decisions”,Radevstressed.
“I appeal to the politicians in theRNM: it is time for political leadership and responsibility in the name of the future, because the road to Europe is a way forward, not backward”, the president said.
Meanwhile, the President of RN Macedoniasaidthat such humiliations as the country has experienced in negotiations withBulgariahas never been seen with Greece for 20 years of negotiations.

“The proposals of the French Presidency are the best so far, I'm not just talking aboutBulgaria- they are the fairest. (...) Let it be clear: we really have progress for a change in the constitution ofNorth Macedoniaand the entry of Bulgarians into the document, which I have been insisting on for a long time. It is already accepted for this to happen”.
This was stated today by BulgarianPresidentRumenRadevduring his visit to Latvia. He stressed that this is not about a Bulgarian minority in our western neighbor, but about the equality of Macedonian Bulgarians, which they deserve and which is required by the Copenhagen criteria.
What did France offer us to let Macedonia join the EU
""For a year now, we have been persistently fighting - both asBulgaria's representative in the EU and the two caretaker governments - to raise bilateral issues to EU level and a negotiating framework. This is not just a bilateral historical dispute betweenBulgariaandNorth Macedonia, as it appears. These are issues that are undermining the EU's foundations. Finally, after much debate, our European partners have realized that this is the place to address these issues, and our demands are already being addressed in the negotiating framework as an approach,"" he said.
The head of state said that if the framework position ofBulgaria, adopted in 2019, will be changed in any way, the Council of Ministers, with the expertise of the Foreign Ministry, should update the framework position with its decision and only then send this position, which reflects the decision of the French Presidency, in Parliament - to be approved. According toRadev, ""the current approach cannot work"":
""This is the way, not the other way around, as it is at the moment, which leads to a blockade and an inability to make a decision. The body that should draft this decision is the Council of Ministers, and the parliament should approve it. That must be known, of course, and not speculated. ""
Radevstressed that the condition is to first change the Macedonian constitution by adding and Bulgarians, and only then to start Skopje's negotiations with the EU. ""It's already an active approach,"" he said.
ThePresidentcalled on the Bulgarian Parliament and Government to make an expert opinion on the issue and to make sure that the bilateral protocol to be signed betweenBulgariaandNorth Macedoniasufficiently defendsBulgaria's interests because it must become part of the negotiating framework.
""From now on, all relations will be built on this protocol. This is the key to a fair solution to the issue. One thing is clear - there is absolutely no time at the moment,"" thepresidentsaid.
""I cannot accept open calls for political nomadism and change of parties""
RumenRadevresponded to accusations by BSP leader Kornelia Ninova that he was attacking the government along with GERB and DPS: ""Have you ever seen me stand by GERB and DPS? This is absurd. GERB's policy. Long before the protests took place, my position on GERB's policy was known. Even before the protests, I took away the trust.""
""I cannot accept open calls for political nomadism. People have voted in a certain way and, in my opinion, calls to start this political nomadism in the Bulgarian parliament distort people's votes. I hope the parties attract members with their policies, not leave to go elsewhere. This is my sincere position,"" thepresidentsaid.
According to him, many important issues are to be resolved in the coming days and weeks, and the current government and parliament cannot escape them: ""This must be clear before there is any talk of a vote on early voting.""
ThePresidentis of the opinion that the elections are the final and extreme option that will be reached if the blockade of state institutions continues.
RumenRadevalso claims that he has never escaped responsibility so far and that all three cabinets appointed by him have coped with the challenges facing them.

Both RumenRadevand KarenDonfriedcondemned and declared inadmissible thearsonof the Bulgarian Cultural Center ""Ivan Mihailov"" in Bitola. According to the head of state, the arson of the cultural center of Macedonian Bulgarians in Bitola was carried out by people who seek to keep the Republic ofNorth Macedoniain the shadow of Yugoslavia's totalitarian past and hinder the process of European integration.
RumenRadevexpressedBulgaria's expectation for timely actions by the institutions in our southwestern neighbor, which will prevent this act of aggression against the Macedonian Bulgarians from remaining undetected and unpunished.
A statement from the US Embassy said that the Assistant Secretary of State and the President had continued ongoing discussions on a number of topics of mutual interest, including security, energy security, economic development and regional cooperation.
“The Assistant Secretary of State strongly condemned the recent arson of the Bulgarian Cultural Center in Bitola, Republic ofNorth Macedonia, whose clear goal is to undermine the ongoing negotiation process between the two neighboring countries”, the embassy said. KarenDonfriedreaffirmed the United States' firm commitment to partnering withBulgariato promote security, democracy and economic opportunities for our two peoples, the US Embassy said in a statement.
In November 2020, Sofia blocked the start of negotiations with Skopje for EU membership due to bilateral disputes over language and history, AFP notes.

""There is no progress on the open issues between Sofia and Skopje, so there are no conditions for my visit to Paris underPresidentMacron, I want to see real results, I appreciate the commitment and efforts of our European partners. As for the conviction of Prime Minister Kiril Petkov that the last resort on the subject of the Republic of North Macedonia is the parliament, I must clarify that the last resort is always the people and there are constitutional mechanisms for their consultation,"" said Rumen Radev.
He explained that he was closely monitoring the positions of the political parties. He also commented on the upcoming budget update.
""Many countries have already updated their budgets, if there is no certainty we cannot talk about economy, education, culture and science,"" he added.
According to him, the refugees turned out to be a painful topic. RumenRadevstressed that the policy of the Bulgarianstatemust be careful and consistent on the subject.
""In the beginning, the main priority was to integrate them, but now we are scratching that. We have an acute shortage of qualified specialties such as doctors, nurses and engineers, anyone who wants to work, their children to study in our schools, should get such an opportunity but refugees must also follow the instructions of the Bulgarian institutions. If you want support from the Bulgarianstate, you must respect its decisions,"" RumenRadevadded.
According to him, full European integration is a strategic goal forBulgaria, and the adoption of the euro is enshrined in the Bulgarian membership of the European Union.
""There must be a clear identification of the risks, together with a plan for the introduction of the euro, a plan to neutralize the potential negative consequences, to increase incomes, because if there are inadequate decisions they are not paid by those who take them, but by citizens"", added Rumen Radev.

“On May 24 we are all Bulgarians. In the hierarchy of spirit and culture, neither wealth nor power is authoritative. The nobility of the spirit is important here. And it is worn and radiated by every awake child”. This was commented byPresidentRumenRadevin an address on the occasion of May 24.
""Today there are seven million Bulgarians in Bulgaria. Millions of others are outside the Fatherland. But there is always an invisible homeland that everyone takes with them wherever they go. This is theBulgarianlanguage. From birth we are destined to think and feel the beautiful, rich, sonorous, nuanced and expressive native speech.Languageinspires us,languagecomforts us.Languageis our home and trust in difficult and lonely moments, especially far from the Motherland. In difficult years,languageis the banner of satire, rebellion and freedom. When the spirit fades,languageis the most accurate epicrisis: it suffers from our spelling, impoverishes its active vocabulary, its grammar disintegrates. Even our pronunciation is careless,"" he said.
""But thelanguageof Vazov and Dalchev, of Zahari and Yavorov, of Petar Uvaliev and Valeri Petrov will not perish. It will survive all sorts of gloomy times of stupidity, rudeness, and foreign worship, and the experiments of the ‘foolish fools’ who arbitrarily handle their words. TheBulgarianlanguagewill outlive the intrigues of its deniers and its prodigal relatives who do not recognize their origin or kinship with our speech. The complexes of those who allow us to abandon the Cyrillic alphabet will also survive,"" thepresidentsaid.
Radevrecognizes that times are changing. ""Today, Bulgarians are everywhere, and our children and grandchildren often speak several languages. But the nativelanguage, as I have had occasion to say before, is the thread through which our compatriots by blood can always find their way home"", the head of state commented.

""I cannot compromise with the rights of Macedonian Bulgarians. They must be in the Constitution.""This was stated by Bulgarian President RumenRadevin his half-hour speech at the opening of a conference on ""European perspective for good neighborly relations between the Republic ofBulgariaand the Republic of NorthMacedonia"".
The forum is organized by the Institute for Historical Research at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the Macedonian Scientific Institute and under the patronage of the head of state. The conference is in memory of Gotse Delchev, whose death today marks 119 years.
According toRadev, he does not agree with the formula reached by Prime Minister Kiril Petkov and EC President Ursula von der Leyen - the change in the Constitution to be guaranteed by the EU, to be introduced together with the package of measures of the neighborly agreement between the two countries in the negotiating chapters. This will not only unblock the accession of NorthMacedoniato the EU, but will also protectBulgaria's position.
“I am convinced that the European future of the Republic of NorthMacedoniahas no alternative”,said RumenRadevat the beginning of his speech and added that he was convinced of the desire of the people on both sides for full communication. He recalled thatBulgariawas the first country to recognize the independence of the young Macedonian state in 1992.
""We have unconditionally supported NorthMacedonia's membership in NATO, provided guarantees for its security."" If we want our relations to develop strategically, we must be honest in our dialogue,""Radevsaid. He added that an anti-Bulgarian campaign involving state institutions, media and political parties is still raging in Skopje.
""Cohesion processes have been blocked, Corridor 8 has remained in the sphere of declarations. The 2017 Good Neighborly Relations Agreement is not being implemented, the work of the Committee on Historical and Educational Processes has been blocked,""the president said. He said Skopje was using all means of lobbying to its advantage, and last year's ""scandalous census"" highlighted the problems of our compatriots.
""The war in Ukraine is being used as an argument for urgent and immediate integration at the cost of tough compromises,""Radevsaid. According to him, we are facing historic elections and ""this is an issue that affects the foundations of our national identity - our dignity, as a people, sustainability and the future of the EU, even if this is not assessed by our partners.""
According toRadev, we are currently facing a""dilemma of how to do it, so that we can agree as soon as possible to start integration talks, while setting a clear barrier to militant Macedonianism and protecting our history and identity.""
""What guarantees do we have to reach a European format? What are the factors, the driving forces, what is their genesis?""The president asked. Then he answered:
“I cannot compromise with the rights of Macedonian Bulgarians. They must be in the constitution.”
Radevexplained that this is important so that Bulgarians in NorthMacedoniacan""integrate into our neighbor's economic life"".He described the inclusion of ""Bulgarians"" among the ""people's nationalities"" in the constitution as a ""barrier to ending the process of de-Bulgarianization"".
""I can't accept the multi-perspective approach to our history, I can't agree with the theft of our history,""Radevsaid, adding that ending hate speech is extremely important.""This starts with changing the history and geography textbooks. I cannot accept that the young generation is being brought up in a language of hatred towards Bulgaria. There is no way we can move forward unless the archives of the UDBA (Yugoslav Secret Service) are declassified so that it becomes clear about the thousands killed just because they are called Bulgarians. As all Eastern European countries have experienced their catharsis,Macedoniacannot but break with its totalitarian past and steadily embark on its path to democracy.”
According to RumenRadev, the EU is not aware of the potential of Macedonianism for destabilization.
""We need to integrate partners, not problems. With these things, as President of the Republic ofBulgaria, I cannot compromise,""Radevsaid. The big question is whenBulgariawill agree to start negotiations, said the head of state and added once again:
I have always said that this should be after the Constitution is changed.
He explained that thevetoshould not be lifted before that, because we have had a good neighborly agreement for 5 years, ""but what happened, has anything changed?"" According to RumenRadev, there is no guarantee that something will change. How will the EU guarantee, he asked, adding that Skopje shows a lack of willingness to respect human rights, which is enshrined in the Copenhagen criteria for EU accession.
Once again,Radevsaid it was""for""opening the door to negotiations when we see clear guarantees for an irreversible process. He added that the EU misunderstood our position and paradoxically""all methods of lobbying and pressure onBulgariaare being used through our allies and European institutions to lift thevetofor the start of NorthMacedonia's EU membership talks"".
Radevdid not fail to ""sting"" the 42 intellectuals and public figures fromBulgariaand NorthMacedonia, who announced yesterday the fall of thevetoand announced the creation of a network of friendship clubs, which aims to ""create an active civil society to works for the rapprochement of the two countries on the basis of European values ​"":
""It is amazing how Bulgarian intellectuals, who swear by European values ​​from morning till night, are actually ready to overrun European values, and the Copenhagen criteria and say - forward immediately, we raise everything unconditionally. The same intellectuals who have no doubt that they are fierce anti-communists but legitimize the ideas of the Communist International. I think thatBulgariahas many, many other intellectuals and I thank you for being here.""
""It is wonderful that the energetic new prime ministers of both countries have taken a new path. I want to see a calendar schedule for resolving open political issues, because if we do not resolve them, all this and the efforts of both governments will go into the background. It is important to clarify the problems and our position. I can say thatBulgariais not acting from a position of strength, but of truth and responsibility to the EU. This is the strength of our position and it must be defended in all formats"", insisted the head of state
He drew attention to draft US Resolution 741, which, if adopted, will be declared September a month of Macedonian language, culture and history in contributing to the country's development.“This thing is being done under the noses of diplomats”, he stressed.Radevinsisted that only the organizations responded and thanked our Consul General in Chicago for his address to the Illinois Congress because it showed how we stand for our policy.

Bulgarian President RumenRadevsaid“those who insisted on sending military aid toUkrainewere either behaving irresponsibly because they could not assess the risks toBulgariaor because they were ignorant.”
During a visit to Plovdiv, the head of state said that in the first hours of the war he had convened a consultative meeting of the country's government, where they clearly and unequivocally condemned the Russian Federation's aggression in Ukraine. The President stressed thatBulgariais a loyal member of NATO and the EU and is in solidarity with our partners and allies, but""there is a feeling that many people speak without having their own opinion""and speak according to the requirements of our partners.
""People who instill these militaristic sentiments and constantly insist on providingweaponsdo not make significant differences. Unlike our partners,Bulgariais much closer to this conflict - we have a real common border on the Black Sea. We also have a huge historical diaspora in Ukraine. We are much more dependent on Russian gas. So the people who make the decision must take into account the security of the Bulgarians. Others, in my opinion, do so out of ignorance without even assessing the risk"",said Rumen Radev.
The head of state asked several questions to politicians who want to provide military assistance toUkraine: to assess the level of air security for those living from Durankulak to Sofia; the condition of the Bulgarian fighter aircraft; how long our Euro-Atlantic allies will be in the country - the Dutch Air Force is here until the end of May, whether there are any plans after that and what is the state of the Bulgarian radar system.
""Let these people answer these questions. Do they know according to the graded response plans with our allies what the deadlines are and what is the process of the delegated forces that need to come here? What will be their capacity? If they know the answers to these questions and they keep insisting, so their behavior is irresponsible, if they don't know them, it's just ignorant.""
Radevhinted that the suspension of Russian gas was due to intermediaries
According to the president, Europe is late in making a common decision on Russian gas, as Russia has long warned of what could happen.Radevstressed that he did not justify the Russian side because it had violated its agreement withBulgaria:
“The question is what didBulgariado, given that it knew there was such a potential danger. Did Bulgargaz sign a direct supply contract for May? If it did, what would the price be - probably 70 euros. Are there any contracts for intermediaries, why did intermediaries appear? MET Energy - at what price, MM ENERGY - at what price? If it turns out that intermediaries enter the game, something I talked about with the removal of the former management of Bulgargaz, isn't this targeted? If the price jumps by 30%, hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians and small and medium-sized enterprises will be on the brink, how will we bear this blow? If the solution is new aid loans, the economy will collapse someday.”
The Bulgarian Socialist Party will find a way to stay in the coalition
RumenRadevis of the opinion that if a decision is finally made to send military aid toUkraine, the BSP leadership ""will find a wording that will not be responsible if something is sent, but will remain in the coalition.""
Accident with a car of NSS on the way to Plovdiv
Radevalso commented on the incident with the National Security Service (NSS) car, which was moving in front of the president's car on the way to Plovdiv.
""The NSS car, which was moving before me, had an accident - a truck jumped overtaking. The doctor of my team, who I immediately took in my car and drove to a hospital in Plovdiv, was injured - he has a fractured elbow joint. The traffic was heavy, Plovdiv is an industrial city, heavy transport equipment is running. It is high time to resolve the issues with the bypass roads of Plovdiv, the incident happened in the narrowest sections of the road,""said Rumen Radev.
Earlier today, the NSS announced that two of their employees were injured after being hit by a truck that entered the opposite lane at around 10 o'clock today. The service pointed out that the victims were in contact and were taken to a medical institution for examination. The NSS also informed that the official car of the NSS, which did not transport a guarded person, was damaged.

""It is cynical in the most energy-poor country in the EU, with the poorest people to say 'we will find another solution, we will pay more.' Some people may pay more, but others are on the edge and cannot pay more. Those who can afford to pay more and make decisions need to think about those who can't afford it. ""
This was stated by President RumenRadevduring his visit to Spain. With these words, he again criticized the government of Kiril Petkov - this time because he decided to look for alternatives to the suspendedRussiangas.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Kiril Petkov, Deputy Prime Minister Asen Vassilev and Energy Minister Alexander Nikolovsaidseveral times that they would not be blackmailed, which they said was the suspension ofRussiangassupplies due toBulgaria’s refusal to pay in rubles. The three are adamant that the request violates the agreement and that they will look for alternatives toRussiangas, which, however, could increase the price for end users. At the same time, the energy minister said that a project for a pan-Europeangaspurchase was being prepared, which would be several times cheaper than Russia's due to economies of scale.
Radevdid not say categorically whether he would lose his trust in the government if parliament decided to send military aid to Ukraine. He would wait for the debate in plenary. At this stage, the president would not convene the National Security Advisory Council (NSAC) because""there are too many topics"".
Asked if the government was dealing with the crises, he said: ""This will be shown by the people I see more and more on the streets. We need to think more about the Bulgarians who are in the most difficult situation in these crises.""
The head of state commented on today's statement by Kiril Petkov, who linked the sending of weapons to Ukraine with the April Uprising, as a comparison ""far from reality"".
Bulgariaand Spain
The President assured thatBulgariaand Spain have excellent relations and political dialogue with great opportunities for cooperation.
""What we can learn from and cooperate with is the way Spain is making its green transition. Over 50% of energy is from renewable sources. In our country we must follow their experience in tourism - it is a destination with year-round tourism. Spain relies heavily on us for the supply of grain foods, the country is at the top of our list,""Raev said.
This is the first visit of a Bulgarian president to the country since 1999.
Radevalso met with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Later, he and his wife, Desislava Radeva, will be greeted with an official ceremony by King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia at the Zarzuela Palace. Tomorrow the President will pilot Eurofighter - the type of fighter jets that have been protectingBulgaria's airspace since February.

En el encuentro, ambos han analizado la evolución de laguerra en Ucraniay han comentado la decisión anunciada la víspera por la gasística Gazprom decortar el suministro a Polonia y Bulgariapor negarse a pagar en rublos como exige ahora Moscú para sortear parte de las sanciones financieras impuestas por la UE.
Una decisión que ha lamentado Sánchez en su reunión con Radev y que según ha calificado en las redes sociales se trata de un ""inaceptable chantaje ruso"".
Las instituciones europeas criticaron también esa decisión yse ha convocado una reunión extraordinaria de los ministros de energía de laUEel próximo 2 de mayo para abordar la situación.
Según Sánchez, los efectos del ataque ordenado por el presidente ruso,Vladímir Putin, redoblan la importancia de unas relaciones entre España y Bulgaria que ha calificado de excelentes.
En el marco de esas relaciones, Sánchez y Radev han comentado la presencia decuatro cazas españoles y 130 militares del Ejército del Aireque se desplegaron en Bulgaria desde febrero y hasta finales de marzo en el marco de una misión de la OTAN de refuerzo de policía aérea.
La OTAN puso en marcha esta misión en 2014 tras la anexión ilegal de la península de Crimea por parte de Rusia con el objetivo de disuadir a este país de la agresión contra los aliados de la Alianza Atlántica.
España desplegó este destacamento el 11 de febrero, trece días antes de que Rusia comenzase su invasión contra Ucrania y fuela primera vez que se enviaban cazas españoles a Bulgaria para apoyar las medidas de disuasión y defensa de la Alianza.
Diversos asuntos de la agenda europea y la próxima cumbre de laOTANque se celebrará los días 29 y 30 de junio en Madrid han sido otros de los asuntos tratados en la reunión entre Sánchez y Radev.
El presidente del Gobierno tenía previstoemprender este jueves un viaje a Moldavia y Poloniapara expresar a las autoridades de estos países su apoyo ante la labor que están realizando en la acogida de refugiados ucranianos.
También iba a abordar en Varsovia cómo afecta la decisión rusa de cortar su suministro de gas a Polonia.
Sin embargo, ha pospuesto ese viaje para facilitar su presencia en el Congreso con el fin de votar este jueves el decreto con las medidas para hacer frente a los efectos económicos y sociales de la guerra en Ucrania.

Thestatementof BulgarianPresidentRumenRadevthatBulgariashould not provide weapons toUkrainebecame headline news for the media in Kyiv and received a wide negative response in one of the most visited Ukrainian news channels onTelegram- NEXTA live.
“Go to f*** yourself,PresidentofBulgaria,""(Иди нахуй in Ukrainian, reminiscent of theslogan used for the Russian warship) wrote one of the channel's users.
Ukrainians also call on Putin to send troops toBulgaria, call for a check of the head of state for corruption and ties with Moscow, call him a bandit and a bastard.
There are also a number of opinions that the position expressed byRadev(""on whom nothing depends"")is supported only by the Bulgarian Socialist Party from the coalition partners in government.
""Just because thepresidentis an asshole doesn't mean the nation is bad,""another user wrote.
One Bulgarian explained that our country is a parliamentary republic and that thepresidentdoes not make decisions, but is a disgrace to the country.
Another Bulgarian calls him ""presidentof the Kremlin"", and a third adds that the Bulgarian prime minister iscurrently in Kyivand will probably announce thatBulgariawillprovide military assistancetoUkrainesoon.

“There must be a careful approach to this conflict, which directly affects everything. There are a number of revelations about where the Bulgarian weapons are going. I wonder how the Minister of Energy will explain to the Bulgarians that Bulgarian weapons are fueling this conflict.”This was stated by President RumenRadevbefore he left for Spain today.
“As for gas, we have to answer a few questions, why onlyBulgariaand Polandare cut off gas supplies,”Radevasked.
“How do Germany andAustriapay, is there enough reserved capacity for deliveries fromGreeceand other countries, because if it is not reserved for us, we will see how intermediaries grab it. We will probably have to find alternative solutions, but this will also require time and money and means much higher prices and delivery risks,”the president added.“I have repeatedly stated that these 3 billion paid from our budget do not serve the Bulgarian interest, they serve other countries that transit gas for free. What is happening with the gas supply will be a test of European solidarity. Will and how will the EU help the most energy-dependent and energy-poor country”,Radevasked rhetorically.
“The government owes a definite response to the citizens. It is high time for the government to give clear evidence that it is aware of and upholds Bulgarian sovereignty,”Radevwas adamant.
“Definitely ‘No’ to the provision of military assistance toUkraine, this means a step towards the direct involvement ofBulgariain this conflict. Calls for peace fade in their place, and sharp rhetoric and calls for victory escalate. If victory means self-destruction and economic liquidation of Europe, then we are rapidly moving in this direction,”Radevadded.“Bulgariamust be part of the efforts for peace and an end to this conflict as soon as possible. Prolonging the conflict will have disastrous consequences in many ways. The sovereign Bulgarian position is being worked out in Sofia, not in Kyiv, and I don't think there is a need for avisitthere”,Radevwas adamant.

On the festiveEasternight, the Patriarchal Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky was filled with solemn chants praising the risen Savior and the candle flames of those present at theEasterservice.

""May the joy that the Savior'sresurrectionbrings us always be with us and may this joy be complete,""the synodal message said.
“Let us follow the light that illuminates our path to eternal life and the kingdom of God and work diligently for our salvation. Let us not be indifferent observers of the evil and injustice that surround us, but active lordly collaborators in the daily struggle for life - benefactors, peacemakers, worthy of the name of Christ.""
The service was also attended by Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha with his wife Margarita, as well as many believers, including families with their children.
The Blessed Fire descended in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem - something that happens in an unusual way every year, but this year the Holy Synod of theBulgarianOrthodox Church decided that no trip to Jerusalem will be organized and onEasterin theBulgarianchurches fire from last year would be given out.
It was announced that the graceful fire could be taken from the capital's synodal chapel ""St. Tsar Boris-Mihail"".
The gracious fire is kept in many places in our country. In the churches and monasteries mainly - says the Bishop of Melnik Gerasim, General Secretary of the Holy Synod:
""The fire of grace is a miracle that, along with many other miracles, proves theresurrectionof our Lord JesusChrist, shows it to people who doubt, who are reluctant to believe without seeing, so miracles are sent to earth by God. The gracious fire always descends only to the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, which for us Orthodox is an even greater testimony that we are on the right path and that our faith is truly rescued "".

Bulgarian President RumenRadevmade a sharp statement to the authorities in the Republic of North Macedonia. He said,“it was high time the anti-Bulgarian ideology swirling in our neighboring country to stop.”
The head of state's statement comes after the president and prime minister ofNorth Macedoniaspoke negativelyabout theopeningof a Bulgarian cultural center in Bitola named after the revolutionary Ivan Mihailov, who according to Stevo Pendarovski and Dimitar Kovachevski collaborated with the Hitler regime.
However, according to PresidentRadev, this rhetoric""deliberately poisons relations between the two countries and undermines the path of the Republic ofNorth Macedoniato the EU"".
The head of state also said that politicians in the neighboring country were trying to build an identity based on the falsifications of the Communist International:
""And if we talk about fascism, it should be clear that Ivan Mihailov was the man who refused Hitler to involve Macedonia in a fratricidal war with Bulgaria. Not Ivan Mihailov, but other people after the establishment of the Yugoslav dictatorship in Macedonia killed and inquisited tens of thousands in concentration camps only because they decided to continue to call themselves Bulgarians, not Macedonians. This is real fascism. ""
The President reiterated his position on the provision of weapons byBulgariato Ukraine. He is adamant that our country must continue to help all people seeking salvation from the war, andBulgariawill continue to helpUkrainewithin its capabilities.
""Let it be very clear that, unlike other countries that are far from the conflict,Bulgariahas a huge diaspora, historical. We have our compatriots inUkrainewho are currently in the zone of military operations. This requires very careful and responsible decision/ That is why I have long said thatBulgariashould provide personal protective equipment.""
The President's comment was on thedecisionadopted by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly - our country to provide technical assistance for self-defense of Ukraine.

Na visita oficial a Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa e Rumen Radev sustentaram que a UE e a NATO têm de atuar à luz dos princípios dos seus tratados, mesmo que se confirme o alegado uso de armas químicas por parte da Rússia na Ucrânia. Chefes de Estado pedem investigação a crimes de guerra
Isabel Paulo
Jornalista
O Presidente da República salientou, esta terça-feira, no Porto, que a NATO e a União Europeia têm de continuar a""atuar dentro dos limites""dos tratados internacionais, embora condene a violação do direito humanitário na invasão da Ucrânia por parte da Rússia.
Questionado sobre o alegado uso de armas químicas em Mariupol, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa rejeitou uma eventual mudança de posição dos países membros da UE e da NATO quanto à intervenção na guerra na Ucrânia, repisando que, se o que se defende é o cumprimento dos tratados internacionais, também é preciso respeitá-los.""A violação do direito humanitário deve levar a UE e a NATO a mudar de posição? A resposta é não"", sustentou o Chefe de Estado português, numa conferência de imprensa conjunta na Fundação de Serralves, no primeiro dia da visita oficial do seu homólogo búlgaro a Portugal, que teve início esta terça-feira, no Porto.
Para Marcelo, ""tudo o que suscite problemas e não cumprimento do Direito Internacional, nomeadamente humanitário, deve ser investigado pelas instituições competentes"", mas, sem colocar em causa ""em qualquer circunstância"" os valores, os princípios e ""as regras dos tratados europeus e os que presidem à NATO"".
Apesar de considerar que ""o uso de armas químicas é uma completa violação de todos os tratados internacionais e que matar civis durante a guerra é um crime de guerra"", Presidente da República da Bulgária também apelou ao respeito pelos tratados internacionais, alertando para as consequências de uma intervenção da NATO em território ucraniano.""Uma intervenção da NATO é uma questão muito delicada devido ao grande risco de uma Terceira Guerra Mundial"", afirmou Rumen Radev, advertindo para a ""enorme preocupação"" que a guerra em curso possa escalar para um conflito nuclear.
""A Federação Russa possui seis mil armas nucleares. É necessário encontrar todos os meios para acabar com os atos criminais praticados, mas sem colocar em risco o mundo"", salientou o Chefe de Estado búlgaro, não escondendo temer um conflito global. Tal como Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Radev apelou também a que as violações dos tratados internacionais sejam investigadas para""acabar com os atos criminosos"", sem, contudo, ""alargar o conflito"".
O Presidente da República da Bulgária foi ainda mais longe do que Marcelo, ao defender que, apurada a verdade, ""os responsáveis pelos atos bárbaros devam ser punidos"" de imediato.""Quantas mais vítimas inocentes houver, mas difícil será chegar à paz"", sentenciou Rumen Radev.
Como na cerimónia desta manhã, na Câmara do Porto, onde Rui Moreira entregou ao visitante as chaves da cidade, o presidente búlgaro louvou a amizade entre Portugal e a Bulgária, salientando que, apesar da distância geográfica que os separa, ""situados em duas pontas da Europa, não os inibe de cooperar e pensarem juntos o futuro da UE.
Na cerimónia desta manhã, Rui Moreira e Rumen Radev lembraram que Portugal e Bulgária enfrentam o grave desafio da demografia, envelhecimento da população e emigração. Sobre o Porto, o Presidente da República da Bulgária sublinhou a importância da cidade ""invencível"" que teve um papel importante na história de Portugal, país que teve ""a coragem e o compromisso para explorar o desconhecido, cruzar oceanos e descobrir mundos"".

“The use of chemical weapons and the killing of civilians during conflict is a war crime. After witnessing so many innocent civilian victims already, our call is for the possible organization of an independent international investigation as soon as possible.”Thus, Bulgarian President RumenRadevcommented on the war in Ukraine fromPortugal, where he is on an official visit.
“We must understand the truth and all those responsible for these barbaric acts must be punished as soon as possible. If we do not, this war will continue. The more innocent civilian victims there are, the more difficult it will be to establish peace,”the head of state commented.
According toRadev, whether NATO should intervene in the conflict is an extremely delicate issue.“We already have clear statements from the Secretary-General of the Alliance and President Joe Biden, as well as other heads of state, that NATO's intervention in Ukraine poses a huge risk of World War III. The great concern is that this war will not escalate into a nuclear conflict. At least 6,000 nuclear warheads are in the Russian Federation's arsenal,”he warned.
Radevis adamant that all possible opportunities should be sought to stop“criminal acts”without risking a global conflict with irreparable consequences.
The decision for North Macedonia
Radevrecalled thepositionstated before Albanian President Ilir Meta thatBulgariaunconditionally supports the start of Albania's EU membership talks.“I would like to thankPortugalas far as the Republic of North Macedonia is concerned, that during the extremely successful Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU, the 1 + 5 package was developed, which is now 1 + 4,”the president said.
“Extremely effective, well-thought-out package based on the implementation of clear principles enshrined in the Copenhagen criteria concerning non-discrimination, respect for human rights, eradication of hate speech, mutual respect, preservation ofBulgaria's cultural and historical heritage in RN Macedonia”he added.
According to the president, valuable time has been lost in looking for other ways to open the door to start membership talks for North Macedonia.“We will need more time for RNM to meet the requirements of this package,”Radevsaid. He added:“If the Macedonian side had already started working intensively on this package, which was developed during the Portuguese presidency, I could now give an affirmative answer,”the head of state said.
Bilateral relations withPortugal
“The history of relations betweenBulgariaandPortugalis an example of mutual understanding and cooperation. We are connected by a sincere friendship based on common values ​​and understandings for the future of Europe,”Radevsaid.
“We appreciate the achievements in the development of bilateral relations with Portugal. At a time of testing, of challenges to European unity, it is of the utmost importance that the two outermost countries show that they can work together, reaffirm their common vision and goals for a more secure European Union,”he said.
RadevthankedPortugalfor its readiness to participate in strengthening NATO's eastern flank with a military contingent.“This is extremely important to demonstrate our determination and unity in upholding our freedom, democracy and values,”he added.
Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa thankedRadevfor his third visit to the country in three years.“This shows well the friendship between nations, peoples and the friendship between us that unites us. I congratulate you and thank you for your presence,”he said.

Radev: Providing weapons to a warring country poses a risk to the security of Bulgarians
President RumenRadevreiterated that as head of state he would not allowBulgariato be involved in the military conflict in Ukraine. He answered a question about the parties' proposal to send military support.
“Providing weapons to a belligerent party poses a risk to the security of Bulgarians. When someone proposes such a solution, there must be appropriate justification for what they are proposing so as to minimize that risk,”he said.
Bulgariacan provideUkrainewith Мilitary Equipment but not Aircraft and Defense Systems
He also asked the parties from the former government what they have done to modernize our army so that there is no deficit. We don't have modern planes, ships, you know what ammunition is waiting for disposal, he added.
“Even if we want, we have nothing to give,”the president said.
“Apart from military security, such a decision also poses a risk to economic and social security. It is unacceptable for me to say that in the country with the poorest population in terms of energy security, to stop even with energy supplies,”he added.
Bulgarian PM met with the European Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement
Regarding the negotiations for NorthMacedonia’s EU membership,Radevsaid that he and EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi had come to the realization that there was a problem, that clear concrete actions should be taken to address the rights of Macedonian Bulgarians, to eradicate the language of hatred, for revision of textbooks, so that young people are not educated in the spirit of hatred againstBulgaria, in measures to preserve the Bulgarian cultural heritage.
“We have made some progress in our work. These problems, as he shared, thanks toBulgaria's resilience, are realized and become a commitment of the EU. The question is what tools to ensure the protection of our interests. This is what I expect from the Bulgarian government to categorically protect our national interest,”Radevsaid.
Officially from Skopje: 3504 People in NorthMacedoniaCounted as Bulgarians
Asked what our reaction will be after yesterday's census in the Republic of NorthMacedonia,Radevsaid that he had paid attention to European leaders monitoring the census because we receive many signals of violations.
“This is another proof of the lawlessness and lack of justice of the Bulgarians in the RNM, who do not dare to openly declare that they are Bulgarians, given that over 120,000 people here have proved with a document of origin that they are Bulgarians. This means thatBulgariamust continue with the veto policy of starting membership negotiations until we receive clear guarantees for what I told you just now,”he said.
Bulgaria: New Jump in Gas Prices from April 1
Radevalso commented on the moratorium on prices, which he said took time to gather information, analysis and estimates, and should have clear decisions at the end.
“I expect that the government will take all necessary measures so that all these crises around us and difficult to predict factors around the war inUkraine, to make all changes in electricity prices, energy prices bearable for Bulgarians,”said the president.
Radevalso wanted to hear what the ruling party's vision will be for household consumers to enter the free market. He hopes it will not be hasty and unprepared.
He said that during the consultations on the composition of the government he had said that those who have ambitions to govern should be able to do so even in times of crisis. He expects effective crisis management with a visible effect on sustainable social and economic policies in the interests of Bulgarian citizens.

On the spot, RumenRadevalso got acquainted with the activities of the Emergency Aid and Prevention Directorate at the Sofia Municipality. The functions of the test site, the methods for training students and the emergency rescue methods in different emergency situations were presented.

The reason for the question was the words of President Rumen Radev after the NATO summit in Brussels on March 24. He then stated thatBulgariais ready to lease second-hand fighters from NATO allies, while the delivery of the F-16 ordered in the United States for ourair forceis expected.
Bulgariamight Look for “Second Hand” F-16s or European Fighter Jets on Lease
“The fact that we will eventually have an F-16 combat squadron that will be able to be on combat duty in NATO's integrated system, around 2030, means that we must fill this gap so that we do not lose the most important thing. - ability, pilots, technicians, aviation specialists,”the president said.
The BulgarianAir Forcewill be able to operate the planes shortly after they are delivered in 2025, theUSembassy said.
“We also work closely with our partners in theAir Forceof the Republic ofBulgariato assist in the preparation of infrastructure and maintenance opportunities for aircraft. The eight aircraft F-16 Block 70 thatBulgariapurchased, equipped with the latest radar system and ammunition, will greatly contribute to improving the capabilities of the BulgarianAir Forceand will be an important addition to the capabilities of NATO,”said the diplomatic mission.

“We must be in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and help with everything we can, but whoever decides to provide weapons and thus involveBulgariain the war, must be able to face society and explain the risk, because the price is always paid by the citizens, not by the politicians.”
This was said byPresidentRumen Radev, who is visiting Stara Zagora.
He said that“our main task is to prevent our citizens, our strategic sites, such as our nuclear power plant, from being left without adequate air defense. You can see that drones with charges are falling on the territories of neighboring countries. We must not allow this to happen on our land,”he said.
Asked whether Borissov's arrest was a distraction from the US Secretary of Defense's visit, Radev said the prime minister should be asked.

He is also adamant that a decision on air defense must be made by parliament.
“Everyone who makes that decision has to go out in front of people and explain the risk and the cost,”he said.
ThePresidentexpects the Council of Ministers to provide clear information after the meeting with Lloyd Austin.

Radev reiterated that providing air defense is involvingBulgariain taking part in this war.
Regarding Borissov's arrest, Radev said:“I do not interfere in the work of law enforcement agencies, but justice has not prevailed until the court rules, this is by law.”

This morning, the head of state visited the Thracian University, where the grand opening of the Aquaponics Center took place.
Later in the day,Rumen Radevwill visit the village of Podslon and inspect the lignite-fired gas plant. After that, Radev will visit the 2nd Tundzha Mechanized Brigade, where he will hold a meeting with the main command staff and servicemen of the military formation./BNT

“Whatever the prehistory, whatever the pretext for the war in Ukraine, nothing can justify trampling on the country's national sovereignty, casualties, destruction and great suffering. The war in the immediate vicinity of our borders is radically changing the security environment in the region.”This was said byPresidentRumenRadevafter a meeting with Romanian counterpart Klaus Johannes on Tuesday.
“Europe's security system, built over decades, is collapsing before our eyes. Systems and supply routes, communication lines, their interruption, the threat to energy security, the imposition of unprecedented sanctions on Russia, put our economies and social systems to a great test,”addedBulgaria’s president.
According toRadev, all these processes consolidate the unity and determination of the European Union and NATO for coordinated action across the spectrum of international relations.“RomaniaandBulgariashare a common responsibility for the system of gradual deterrence and defense measures implemented under the auspices of the alliance in order to ensure security and stability in our region,”thepresidentstressed.
According to the head of state, the crisis in Ukraine has highlighted the great need for comprehensive connectivity betweenRomaniaandBulgaria- infrastructure, transport, energy, digital, technological connectivity for new fuel pipelines, especially in crisis and martial law.
“I expect, and this is our common call, to the governments of the two friendly countries, vigorous measures to overcome the drastic backlog of our connectivity over the last 30 years. We have long been talking about bridges, highways, railways, pipelines. This war has clearly shown that it is high time to take vigorous measures and overcome this backlog,”Radevsaid.
Radevexplained that he has always been in favor of increased air policing.“It allows not only for greater security but also for better training of our crews. But I am strongly againstBulgarialosing this ability. If we allow this due to carelessness, ignorance or hysterical ideologizing of the problem, it meansBulgariato abdicate from the protection of its own airspace and from its obligations to NATO's collective defense,”said the President.
In the framework of the bilateral talks, a common goal was specified, in addition to Schengen - the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.“We are together there again and I think that with joint efforts we will soon achieve success,”added our head of state./Nova

El presidente búlgaro, Rumen Radev, ha abierto este viernes las puertas del país a sus homólogos ucraniano y ruso, Volodomir Zelenski y Vladimir Putin, respectivamente, para que se sienten a negociar una salida lo antes posible al conflicto bélico en marcha desde hace dos semanas en el este de Europa.
""Ambas partes se están dando cuenta cada vez más de que la guerra no es la solución. Rusia puede ganar esta guerra militarmente, pero no puede ganar la paz. La paz no se gana con la agresión"", ha dicho Radev durante una visita a la ciudad fronteriza de Ruse, por donde unos 30.000 ucranianos han cruzado desde Rumanía.
""Esta agresión tendrá consecuencias a largo plazo entre los dos países"", ha vaticinado el presidente Radev, quien ha destacado que Bulgaria ""tiene razones"" para poder ser el escenario de unas futuras conversaciones entre Putin y Zelenski, pero siempre ""en coordinación con la Unión Europea"".
""Hay que buscar una única solución europea, un único enfoque europeo"", ha remarcado Radev, quien, por otro lado, también ha defendido que los ucranianos que lleguen a Bulgaria huyendo de la guerra ""deben disfrutar de todos los derechos"" del resto de la población, cuenta el diario búlgaro 'Trud'.
""Los ciudadanos ucranianos deben disfrutar de todos los derechos que tienen los búlgaros"", por lo que ""se debe mejorar la coordinación, eso es lo primero y lo más importante"" porque ""preguntan dónde pueden ir y cómo pueden obtener el estatus"", así que ""el panel de crisis debe proporcionar mejor información"", ha dicho.

Bulgarians CelebrateLiberationDay
“Dear compatriots,
This year we celebrate our national holiday when our Motherland accepts refugees and the war rages near us. The sons of two fraternal peoples are fighting, whose ancestors laid bones on our land, fighting side by side for our freedom as warriors from the army of Tsar Alexander II, which overthrew the Ottoman Empire.
For us Bulgarians, the current fratricidal war is especially painful. That is why my first call today is not to allow the fierceness that is ravaging the lands in the north, in Ukraine, to settle in our hearts, to enter our home.
Let us open our arms to all those in need, as our ancestors once found protection from slavery in Bessarabia, Tavria, Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv, Odessa, Moscow and St. Petersburg. To be human.
Voices were raised not to celebrate today's holiday. But it is precisely the memory gap and revisions of history that are the cause of many tragedies.
No!
We are here to honor the names of our national revivalists, of our rebels, of Paisii, Rakovski, Levski and Botev, of the April revolutionaries of 1876. To all those who, with their work and self-sacrifice, approached the resurrection of Bulgaria.
Today we remember the noble minds of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Gladstone, Darwin, Victor Hugo, Januarius MacGahan and Eugene Skyler, who awakened the world's sympathy for the fate of the Bulgarian people.
Today, we pay tribute to the valiant wars of theLiberationArmy, whether ofRussian,Ukrainian, Belarusian, Romanian or Finnish descent. They are all in the pantheon of our Bulgarian freedom. We honor the memory of our brave volunteers. No one's memory deserves to be cast on political demons.
Dear compatriots,
It is our duty to protect history from the pursuits of outcasts and defilers. Because a nation that allows itself to lose its memory is doomed to lose its freedom as well.
Eternal glory to the thousands of known and nameless heroes who gave their lives for the freedom and independence of the Fatherland!
Long liveBulgaria!”/Nova

Bulgarian PM Wants the Resignation of theDefenseMinister
Here is the complete statement:
“Dear compatriots,
In a few days, we will celebrate our national holiday. The bones of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers who fought side by side in the Russo-Turkish war of liberation and died for the freedom ofBulgariarest on Bulgarian soil. That is why the current fratricide is especially painful for us, the Bulgarians. Nothing can justify sacrifice, destruction and great suffering. The normal person cannot forgive the sight of dead people, fleeing mothers with children, broken destinies. The people of Ukraine do not deserve such a fate. Nor the blackened families of the dead Russian soldiers.
Solidarity, vigorous and comprehensive action are needed to end this insane aggression as soon as possible. Every day of this war is a defeat for both Ukraine and Russia. Peace is not won by aggression and trampling on sovereignty.
In this regard, the presidents of the countries of Eastern Europe have come out with a general call on the EU to give Ukraine an accelerated European perspective by granting the status of a candidate country for membership negotiations. Ukraine has a right to exist and a future in a united Europe.
We must not have any illusions: the consequences of this war will be severe not only for the warring countries but also for the whole of Europe and especially forBulgariawith our high energy dependence. The energy crisis will deepen. Instability hinders supplies, discourages investment, accelerates emigration, and increases inflation even more. We all pay the price.
Anticipatory decisions are needed. I expect the government to step up work on measures to reduce the effects of the impending crisis: from strengthening energy security to guaranteeing food sovereignty. The cabinet must guarantee the bread of the Bulgarians. Vigorous action is needed to implement the measures adopted by consensus of the last NSAC for the development of our Armed Forces and strengthening the country'sdefensecapacity. To create the necessary conditions for strengthening the collectivedefensein case of deterioration of the security environment.
The replacement of thedefenseminister in the midst of a military crisis in the neighborhood is a risk for which the ruling coalition is responsible. In the election of a minister, the majority must be guided by the understanding of sovereignty, professional competence and the ability to defend the Bulgarian interest.
I expect the efforts to evacuate our compatriots from Ukraine and to settle inBulgariato continue. I want to thank all the municipalities, companies and citizens who offer shelter, food and work to people in need.
Bulgarians have always been tolerant and sympathetic and this difficult moment again shows the maturity of our people.
I believe that this crisis will save us from political pettiness and make us wiser, more united and cohesive as a society.”/BNT

This is notBulgaria's interference in the internal affairs of the RNM, but an expression of concern for the country and its path to EU membership,”Radev said at the beginning of the meeting.
BulgarianPresident: Recognition of DPR and LPR Dooms De-Escalation Efforts
His interlocutors, for their part, saw in his words not another political declaration, but proof that there are modern politicians inBulgariawho understand their problems, dreams and aspirations.
“We insist on actions in the direction of clarifying the historical truth about our common ancestors, which should be clearly and categorically reflected in the educational process of our country. The relations between NorthMacedoniaandBulgariain 20-30 years will be as this educational process created them. It is the foundation on which our good neighborly relations will stand,”said the guests from RNM and announced that they want this to happen before the negotiations begin./Nova

The crisis between Russia and Ukraine has a global dimension and poses a threat not only to thesecurityof Bulgaria and our region but also to the whole of Europe. This was stated byPresidentRumen Radev.
“The dialogue is conducted at the highest level. Bulgaria is part of efforts to reduce tensions. We must all work to avoid a military solution to this crisis. I have said many times that a diplomatic solution must be sought,”the head of state explained.
According to him, however, the biggest threat to our nationalsecurityis the neglect of the armed forces and our allied commitments.“We need to break with this attitude and think about the problems of the army from crisis to crisis,”Radevsaid.
“The commitments of the state leadership to the armed forces must be constant and purposeful and not be limited to the one-time acquisition of equipment and weapons. Modernization is an ongoing process,”the head of state said.
According to him, the declaration of the new government that our nationalsecuritywill be built on the constitutional obligations of the Bulgarian army must be backed by clear commitments, views and support on how we will develop and provide our armed forces.

Naturally, it cannot solve the problems of national security. But its construction is important. It will show that we can work together with our allies and fill the gaps we have over the years. In this way, together we will demonstrate that we can respond to any crisis,”Radevstressed.
Asked when the first eight F-16 planes, which our country is waiting for, will arrive, he replied:“Delivery will be delayed, and not by much. This is extremely worrying. Not only the personnel are being put to the test, but this also leads to risks of Bulgaria losing air sovereignty, as well as the ability to protect its own airspace, which is alsoNATOairspace.”
He added:“You should ask Mr. Borissov(ex-prime minister) and his government about whether the planes will be late and if they are late. When they signed the contract, under what conditions and with what clauses they concluded it.”/Nova

Commenting on the dismissal of the director ofBulgargaz, the president noted that he was worried about inflation - how Bulgarians are coping with rising prices and high bills, as well as the future of energy.
The Entire Management ofBulgargazhas been Replaced
Rumen Radevbelieves that when the government changes the management of companies, it must ensure that there will be no private intermediaries in the supply of natural gas and that Bulgaria will receive it at better prices. And warned:
“In this activity, the cabinet should not be tempted by the inherited management model, which used the services, the boards, the regulators to argue and promote private interests, which it accused of violating the law. Because if the same approach is used, we will not achieve any different results from Borissov's legacy.”
Prime MinisterKiril Petkovassured that he does not intend to return to old management practices, but defended the dismissal of the director of Bulgargaz.
“It was the right decision and from now on peopleneed to know that this will be the way we do things. Anyone who tries to make wrong decisions that will cost all Bulgarians, if we can prove that this is a fact, we will not hesitate for a second to make exactly the same decisions for all other companies.”
“The new board ofBulgargaz, the first thing it did, was to reduce the price by 18% as a proposal to the Energy and Water Regulatory Commission (EWRC).”
Highlights of the Joint Meeting between Prime Ministers of Bulgaria andNorth Macedonia
The president described the prime minister's visit to the Republic ofNorth Macedoniaas “hasty” or “rushed”.
“I have had frank conversations with him. It is also important that Bulgarian diplomacy fully realizes its professional capacity, does not trust external expertise and does not succumb to external pressure.”
Kiril Petkovdisagreed withRumen Radev's assessment and described his visit to Skopje not as hasty but as “terribly late”.
“I would not tolerate delaying this visit, if we do not want the Balkans to remain thepoorest, most corrupt, most uncoordinated place in the European Union, the approach must be changed,”said Kiril Petkov./BNR

PresidentRumen Radevand VicePresidentIlianaYotovawere sworn in for their second term at a solemn ceremony in the National Assembly.
The two, as well as all officials present in the plenary hall, were welcomed by a representative guard company at the central entrance of the National Assembly.
Among those present in the plenary hall were formerPresidentPetar Stoyanov, as well as previous Speakers of the National Assembly - Mikhail Mikov, Borislav Velikov, Ognyan Gerdjikov, as well as Prime Minister Kiril Petkov and cabinet ministers.
Radev andYotovawere greeted on their feet by the deputies of the four parties from the ruling coalition and Vazrazhdane, while the legislators from GERB and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms remained seated.
Rumen Radevis the New-OldPresidentof Bulgaria
In his address after taking the oath,Rumen Radevrecalled that “5 years ago you gave me and entrusted me with the responsible mission asPresidentof Bulgaria to work for the unity and well-being of our people, for the sovereignty and security of our centuries-old state.”
“Five years later, you have again entrusted us, Ms.Yotovaand me, with the difficult task of continuing on the path we took together and taking the first decisive steps. Your trust is the most authoritative assessment of the complex decisions we made during our term of office, of what we have achieved together as a society. On the day we step into the second term, my first words are those of gratitude to you, dear compatriots,”Radev stressed.
“The first presidential term came at a dramatic time when the old authoritarian model of government reached its peak. As society grew increasingly resentful of the corruption, lawlessness, and propaganda on which he relied. The civil revolt in 2020 against the mafiaization of power brought to the surface facts and processes that it kept silent. I don't like it either, but I prefer the truth,”the head of state said.
At the entrance to the National Assembly, representatives of the opposition and the ruling party gave diverse assessments of the current activities ofPresidentRumen Radevduring his first term.
Desislava Atanasova from GERB stated:
“Nopresidenthas ever behaved in this way. It is inexplicable to me how thepresident, who according to the Constitution must be supra-partisan and must be the unifier of all political forces, has become the divider of the nation.”
Stanislav Balabanov from“There Is Such a People”commented:
“The expectations are, of course, that he will continue to be constructive, as he has been so far, and to be a unifier of the nation. Because, if we look at his previous term, it was full of content in terms of the fact that the presidential institution was corrective when something went wrong in the country.”
The official inauguration of Radev andYotovawill take place on January 22 at a solemn ceremony in front of the Monument to the Unknown Soldier.

PresidentRumen Radev's two caretaker governments have unilaterally fired 1,528 people from the state administration and appointed 3,916 others, or 2.5 times as many. This is according to a report by PrimeMinisterKiril Petkov, which he provided to MP Desislava Trifonova (GERB-SDS) in response to her written questions.
Among the fired employees are members of the political cabinets of GERB ministers, but they are a small part of the total, as the number of staff for deputy ministers, chiefs of staff, advisers, and experts in political teams is 188 in the country. There have been no significant changes in these people in the transition from one caretaker government to another, as most ministers have retained their posts and their teams.
The biggest purge took place in the Ministry of Interior, where Boyko Rashkov unilaterally terminated the legal relationship with 682 employees and appointed 1,111 new ones in their place.
151 people released from the administration are suing, with the total amount of their claims amounting to BGN 357,521.
An interesting fact is that 271 people in management positions have been reassigned or transferred to a lower position of their choice./ClubZ
